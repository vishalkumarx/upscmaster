            <h2>WHAT IS CONSTITUTIONALISM?</h2>
            <p>Constitutionalism is the doctrine that a government authority is determined by a body of laws or constitution.</p>
            <p>It refers to efforts to prevent arbitrary government. It prevents it from turning the democratic setup into dictatorial and authoritative.</p>
            <p>Constitutionalism means limited government or limitation on government.</p>
            <p>Constitutionalism recognizes the need for a government with powers but at the same time insists that limitation be placed on those powers.</p>
            <p>It ensures that the freedoms of the individual are given primacy and the State does not encroach upon the liberty of the citizen.</p>
            
            <h3>Constitutionalism in India</h3>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>S.R. Chaudhuri v. State of Punjab (2001):</strong> Supreme Court said the mere existence of Constitution, by itself, does not ensure constitutionalism. Constitutional restraints must not be ignored if found inconvenient to suit "political expediency". We should not allow the erosion of principles of constitutionalism.
            </div>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>New India Assurance Company Ltd. v. Nusli Neville Wadia (2007):</strong> Court said that "For proper interpretation of Constitutional provisions not only the basic principles of natural justice have to be borne in mind, but also principles of constitutionalism involved therein."
            </div>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>IR Coehlo versus state of Tamil Nadu:</strong> The court held that "constitutionalism is a legal principle that requires control over the exercise of government power to ensure that the democratic principles on which the government is formed shall never be destroyed."
            </div>

            <h3>Basic elements of constitutionalism</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Popular sovereignty</li>
                <li>Separation of power</li>
                <li>Responsible and accountable government</li>
                <li>Rule of law</li>
                <li>Independent judiciary</li>
                <li>Ensure and respect individual rights</li>
                <li>Civilian control of military</li>
                <li>Police governed by law and judicial control</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Constitution vs Constitutionalism?</h3>
            <p>The Constitution is a document that contains rules regarding the structure of the government of a country and the governance of the country. The government is bound to follow the Constitution during its reign as ruling power and cannot violate it. The limitations on the government through these rules and regulations slowly add up to the concept of Constitutionalism.</p>
            <p>Constitutionalism says that the Constitution of a country should have restrictions laid down in it to prevent the freedom of the citizens of the country, and to make sure the government does not go beyond its authority.</p>
            <p>A written Constitution is no guarantee for Constitutionalism. Even Nazi Germany had a constitution but that does not mean that it adhered to the philosophy of Constitutionalism.</p>

        <section id="rule-of-law">
            <h2>RULE OF LAW</h2>
            <p>Generally, the rule of law is the principle that no one is above the law and treated equally among citizens. For instance, One may be the Prime Minister or whoever, all are equally subject to the law. That imparts the element of non-discrimination in the concept of the Rule of Law. This concept changed the mode of administration from "King was Law" to "Law is King". It is quite essential for the healthy functioning of democracy.</p>

            <h3>A.V. Dicey told three features of Rule of Law Doctrine:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Supremacy of Law:</strong> No man shall be punished or made to suffer in body or goods except for the violation of law.</li>
                <li><strong>Equality before Law:</strong> There must be equality before the law or equal subjection of all classes to the ordinary law of the land.</li>
                <li><strong>The primacy of the rights of individual:</strong> That is, the constitution is the result of the rights of the individual as defined and enforced by courts of law, rather than constitution being the source of the individual rights. However, this principle does not apply in case of written constitution. It stands modified in India, where it reads that the constitution is the supreme law of land & all other laws in order to be legally valid shall conform to constitution.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Rule of Law vs Law and order</h3>
            <p>Rule of Law should not be equated with law and order. The breakdown of law and order is a temporary phenomenon. Breakdown of Rule of Law means collapse of good governance & breakdown of constitutional machinery.</p>

            <h3>Rule of Law v/s Rule by Law</h3>
            <p>Nazi Germany put Jews in concentration camps and thereafter sent them to the gas chambers. The justification offered was that there was a law which empowered such acts to be done. But that was rule by law, not Rule of Law.</p>
            <p>The existence of a law is necessary but that is not sufficient. The law must have a certain core component which guarantees the basic human rights and the human dignity of every person.</p>
            <p>Rule of Law means that the supreme authority must be granted to Law-which implies that Law should dictate upon what terms like justice, liberty, equality and fraternity must mean and lay down standards for judgments for citizens.</p>
            <p>A Law of Rules on the other hand would mean the rigidity of the fine line of rules that must be adhered to in order to set a thing into motion; rules are made to support the higher principles of Law and must be used in assistance of furthering the Rule of Law.</p>

            <h3>Examples for concerns regarding Rule of Law in India?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fake encounters and Custodial Torture have no place in a govt professedly based on the rule of law.</li>
                <li>Denial of ration due to technical error of Aadhar led to the death of a tribal girl in Chhattisgarh due to hunger.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Importance of Rule of Law</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Definite Path:</strong> Rule of law gives a definitive path to follow irrespective of the situations and provide certainty of actions to be followed by the government. E.g. Demolition of a slum/road side vendors create a dilemma, but is necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Overcome Ethical dilemmas:</strong> Following rule of law will help in overcoming the ethical dilemmas and help civil servants to function without fear or favour.</li>
                <li><strong>Secrecy vs Transparency:</strong> For instance, denial of information under RTI. Following rule of law will help the government in proactive disclosure of information vital for the public, but at the same time withholding the information vital for national security.</li>
                <li><strong>Preferential treatment vs Non-discrimination:</strong> Equality, though a basic virtue to be followed, equity is necessary. Even the constitution under article 14 provides for differential treatment and upholding it will help in overcoming the sense of discrimination created by differential treatment.</li>
                <li><strong>Overcoming public sentiment and maintaining civil service neutrality:</strong> In some situations, it might seem ethically right to circumvent rule of law. E.g. Encountering a child rapist or terrorist and so on. But, Rule of law help in overcoming emotional ambiguities. E.g. Even the terrorist Kasab was prosecuted as per Rule of law'.</li>
                <li><strong>Superior's directive versus Public good:</strong> Irrespective of the superior's directive, the official can always follow rule of law which will be later justified in the court/inquiries.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Relation to the Indian Constitution (How constitution upholds Rule of Law?)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preamble:</strong> Prescribes the ideas of Justice, Liberty and Equality. These all works as foundation stone for Rule of Law.</li>
                <li><strong>Fundamental Rights:</strong> Concept of Rule of law is further enunciated in Part III of the Constitution and are made enforceable. This concept is implicitly mentioned in the fundamental rights of our constitution. The equality before law (Article 14) includes Rule of Law in itself.</li>
                <li><strong>Constitution as source of Power:</strong> All three branches of the government are subordinate i.e. the Judiciary, Legislature and the Executive are not only subordinate to the Constitution but are bound to act according to the provisions of the Constitution.</li>
                <li><strong>Judicial Review:</strong> The doctrine of judicial review is embodied in the Constitution and the subjects can approach the High Court and the Supreme Court for the enforcement of fundamental rights. If the Executive or the government abuses the power vested in it or if the action is mala fide, the same can be quashed by the ordinary courts of law.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>Chief Settlement Commissioner Punjab v. Om Prakash Case:</strong> The Supreme Court observed that rule of law as central and most characteristic feature. The Court added that the doctrine of rule of law rejects the conception of the dual state in which government action is paced in a privileged position of immunity from control by law.
            </div>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Different Powers:</strong> 'Equality of Law' does not mean that the powers of private citizens are the same as the powers of public officials, e.g. a police officer has the power to arrest which the private citizen does not have.</li>

            <h3>Indian Councils Act, 1909 (Morley-Minto Reforms)</h3>
            <p>It is also referred to as the Morley-Minto reforms.</p>
            <p>The Act was a relatively short document, consisted of eight articles and two schedules, and was written in a legal style. Its core feature was the recognition of the principle of elections of members to the central and provincial legislative councils.</p>
            <h4>The Articles of the Act did the following:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Increased the size of various provincial legislative councils.</li>
                <li>Created executive councils in the provinces of Bombay, Madras and West-Bengal.</li>
                <li>Introduced the office of a 'Vice-President' at both at the centre and the provinces.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Act itself was skeletal; it was operationalised by a set of rules and regulations that fleshed out details regarding:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The extent of (limited) franchise.</li>
                <li>Qualifications for members of legislative councils.</li>
                <li>Strikingly, the introduction of separate electorates for Muslims.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>R. Coupland in <em>The Constitutional Problem of India (1944)</em> argues that while the Act could be seen as introducing representative government - British state officials did not think so and underplayed this. Lord Morley himself told the House of Lords: 'if it could be said that this chapter of reforms led directly or necessarily to the establishment of a parliamentary system in India, I for one, would have nothing at all to do with it'.</p>

            <h3>Government of India Act, 1919 (Montague-Chelmsford Reforms)</h3>
            <p>Codified version of the Montague-Chelmsford reforms.</p>
            <p>The Act consisted of 47 sections and 5 schedules and was written in a legal style. It introduced a number of administrative changes, the most important being dyarchy. It put forth a federal structure for India by creating the institutions of the Governor and provincial legislatures.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Eleven provinces were created and some portfolios like public health and education were kept for Indian legislators.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A notable feature of the document was a clause that called for a review of the Act's working after a period of 10 years.</p>
            <p>Ambedkar in a lecture to his students in 1923 referred to the Government of India Act as the 'British Constitution of India'.</p>
            <p>Walter Reid in <em>Keeping the Jewel in the Crown: The British</em> suggests that the ambiguity of self-government in the Act was a reflection of the unique position of India as a colony of the British Empire. The British divided its empire into two: dominions which were bound for self-government and dominions which were 'occupations of use'. The latter would be 'disposed of when they no longer served their purpose'. India, Reid argues, for the British 'fitted into neither category. It would neither be abandoned nor would it move towards self-government'.</p>

            <h3>Government of India Act, 1935</h3>
            <p>Passed by the British parliament in 1935 and came into effect in 1937.</p>
            <p>The Act was written in a legal style, organized around 11 'Parts' and 10 'Schedules'.</p>
            <h4>Some of the key features of the Act were:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The creation of a 'Federation of India' that consisted of two levels: a central executive and parliament, and below it, provinces and princely states.</li>
                <li>It discarded the 'dyarchy' system at the provincial level and allowed for the emergence of popularly elected provincial legislatures.</li>
                <li>Dyarchy was introduced at the central level; key subjects like defence and foreign affairs were under the direct control of the Governor General.</li>
                <li>A federal court was established.</li>
                <li>The franchise was expanded to 14% of the population from 3%.</li>
                <li>Separate electorates were provided for Muslims, Sikhs and others, but not to Depressed Classes.</li>
                <li>Governor enjoyed critical emergency powers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Act played a key role in the drafting of the Constitution of India, 1950. A significant chunk of the Constitution, particularly the administrative provisions, are borrowed from the Act.</p>
            <p>Scholars like Andrew Muldoon have argued that the Act 'was arguably the most significant turning point in the history of the British administration in India'.</p>

            <h3>Indian Independence Act, 1947</h3>
            <p>The Indian Independence Act 1947 was legislation passed by the British Parliament that legally set up the two independent dominions of India and Pakistan. The Act codified British withdrawal from and the partition of India.</p>
            <p>In 1950, the Constitution of India came into effect and India transformed from an independent dominion to an independent constitutional republic.</p>
            <p>In February 1947, the British, through its Prime Minister Clement Attlee, made it clear that they would leave India. The two major political parties at the time the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League welcomed the move but in different forms.</p>
            <p>The British government sent Lord Mountbatten, the last Viceroy, to India to resolve the political crisis to facilitate British withdrawal. It was decided that the partition question would be put to the Provincial Legislative Assemblies of Bengal, Punjab and Sindh. These Assemblies decided that their Muslim majority areas be partitioned. In light of this, the British decided to leave behind a partitioned India and this was done through the Indian Independence Act 1947.</p>
            <p>The Act was written in a legal style, was 22 pages long and organised around 20 sections and three schedules. It set 15 August 1947 as the date when the two independent dominions of India and Pakistan would come into effect. It partitioned the provinces of Bengal, Punjab and Sindh, made necessary changes to Government of India Act 1935, transferred legislative authority to the Constituent Assemblies of India and Pakistan.</p>
            <p>Importantly, while the Act did substantively cut the link between India and Britain, India was still a dominion under the Governor-General who was the representative of the British Crown. Also, Constituent Assembly members were not happy with the fact that India's independence could be traced to the Act. So they did two things: first, the Assembly did not put the final Constitution it drafted to British parliament to approve as was provided for in the Act. Second, it repealed the Act itself through Article 395 of the Constitution.</p>
            <p>It is after the Constitution came into effect on 26 January 1950, that India severed all links with Britain.</p>

            <h3>Constituent Assembly Of India</h3>
            <p>The demand for a Constituent Assembly was accepted by the British Government in principle under the Cabinet Mission Plan of 1946.</p>
            <p>The Constituent Assembly was composed of indirectly elected representatives and nominated members from the princely states. It took two years, eleven months and eighteen days to draft the Constitution.</p>

            <h3>Criticism of the Constituent Assembly</h3>
            <p>The Constituent Assembly faced criticism on several grounds, including the limited franchise through which its members were elected, the dominance of the Congress party, and the length of time it took to frame the Constitution.</p>
            <p>However, these criticisms were countered by the fact that the assembly represented a wide range of social, political and economic viewpoints, and its prolonged deliberations were a necessary result of its efforts to accommodate and reconcile these divergent views.</p>

        <section id="constitutional-amendments">
            <h1>CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS IN INDIA</h1>
            <p>Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru once highlighted the dynamic nature of a constitution, stating that while we strive to make our constitution as permanent and solid as possible, it should also allow for flexibility to adapt to the nation's growth and changing conditions.</p>
            <p>Our Constitution, like any written Constitution, allows for amendments to adapt to changing conditions and societal needs. Until now, the Constitution has been amended 105 times (Note: this number may vary depending on the current date of reading). The process of amendment is defined in Article 368 of the Constitution.</p>

            <h3>PROCESS OF CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Introduction of a Bill:</strong> An amendment can be initiated by introducing a bill in either House of Parliament (not in state legislatures). The bill can be introduced by either a minister or a private member, without requiring prior permission of the President.</li>
                <li><strong>Passing the Bill:</strong> The bill must be passed by a special majority in each House (a majority of the total membership and a two-thirds majority of the members present and voting). In case of disagreement, there is no provision for a joint sitting of the two Houses.</li>
                <li><strong>Ratification by State Legislatures:</strong> If the bill seeks to amend the federal provisions of the Constitution, it must also be ratified by half of the state legislatures by a simple majority.</li>
                <li><strong>Presidential Assent:</strong> Once passed by both Houses and ratified by the necessary state legislatures, the bill is presented to the President, who must give his assent. The President cannot withhold his assent or return the bill for reconsideration. After Presidential assent, the bill becomes an Act, and the Constitution is amended.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>TYPES OF AMENDMENTS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Amendment by Simple Majority of Parliament:</strong> This includes amendments related to admission or establishment of new states, alteration of boundaries of existing states, abolition or creation of legislative councils in states, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Amendment by Special Majority of Parliament (Under Article 368):</strong> This includes amendments to Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles of State Policy, and all other provisions not covered by the first and third categories.</li>
                <li><strong>Amendment by Special Majority of Parliament and Ratification by State Legislatures (Under Article 368):</strong> This includes amendments related to the election of the President, the extent of the executive power of the Union and the states, Supreme Court and high courts, distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the states, representation of states in Parliament, power of Parliament to amend the Constitution and its procedure.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>INFORMAL AMENDMENTS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Judicial Pronouncements:</strong> Landmark cases such as the Kesavananda Bharati case (1973), Minerva Mill case (1980), and Berubari case (1960) have led to significant changes in the Constitution.</li>
                <li><strong>Conventions:</strong> Some unwritten rules have been accepted as having the force of law and have indirectly influenced constitutional changes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>THE NECESSITY OF CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Societal Evolution:</strong> Societal values and norms change with time. For example, the recognition of 'third gender' required constitutional amendment to ensure protection of their rights.</li>
                <li><strong>Technological Advancements:</strong> Rapid changes in technology necessitate amendments. For instance, in the era of the internet and data privacy concerns, relevant constitutional safeguards may need to be instated.</li>
                <li><strong>Fulfilling Social Contracts:</strong> For example, the 73rd and 74th Amendments, which were introduced to realize the dream of 'Gram Swaraj' as envisaged by Mahatma Gandhi.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Representation:</strong> Amendments may be needed to ensure proper representation of all sections of society, like the reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in legislatures.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Backing to Policy:</strong> To align with policy changes, such as the introduction of the GST required a constitutional amendment.</li>
                <li><strong>Structural Adjustments:</strong> Amendments like the abolition of the Right to Property from Fundamental Rights were required for economic considerations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>DANGERS OF CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Excessive Amendments:</strong> Frequent amendments may erode the sanctity of the Constitution, turning it into a plaything of transient political majorities.</li>
                <li><strong>Shift of Power:</strong> Excessive amendments might alter the balance of power between various institutions, such as the Parliament and Judiciary, Centre and States, leading to instability.</li>
                <li><strong>Ambiguity:</strong> Frequent amendments may lead to complexities and ambiguities. For example, the Ninth Schedule has become a bone of contention between the Judiciary and Legislature.</li>
                <li><strong>Encroaching Rights:</strong> Amendments might infringe upon the basic structure or fundamental rights, leading to conflict.</li>
                <li><strong>Undermining Basic Structure:</strong> The 'Basic Structure' doctrine introduced in the Keshvananda Bharti case might get undermined through haphazard amendments.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>CRITICISM OF THE AMENDMENT PROCEDURE</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lack of Clarity:</strong> The Constitution is unclear about the specific procedure to be followed, leading to different interpretations and potential confusion.</li>
                <li><strong>Centralised Power:</strong> Critics argue that the power of amendment is concentrated mainly in the Parliament, thereby neglecting the federal structure.</li>
                <li><strong>No Special Body:</strong> Unlike some countries, India does not have a provision for a special body like a Constitutional Convention for proposing amendments.</li>
                <li><strong>Limited Scope for Public Involvement:</strong> The amendment process does not include provisions for a referendum or direct public involvement, which could enhance the democratic nature of amendments.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>WAY FORWARD</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Setting Up a Joint Parliamentary Committee:</strong> To ensure in-depth deliberation on proposed amendments and consensus-building among all parties.</li>
                <li><strong>Creating a Separate Committee/Body:</strong> This could be dedicated to considering amendments to the Constitution, which could provide better scrutiny and avoid hasty changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Engaging Civil Society:</strong> Public consultations could be held to gauge public sentiment and opinion on major constitutional changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Defining Amendment Procedure:</strong> Clearer procedural guidelines could help reduce confusion and potential misuse of the amendment provision.</li>
                <li><strong>Involve State Legislatures:</strong> Their active participation in the amendment process could ensure a balanced federal structure is maintained.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While constitutional amendments are a necessary tool for ensuring our Constitution remains relevant and adaptable to changing times, it is crucial that they are used judiciously and sparingly to maintain the integrity and stability of our fundamental law.</p>

            <h1>BASIC STRUCTURE & HARMONIOUS CONSTRUCTION</h1>
            <div class="important-box">
                <h4>Context of Amenability of Fundamental Rights (FRs) and Relationship between FRs & DPSP</h4>
                <p>This section discusses the evolution of the Basic Structure doctrine, largely driven by conflicts regarding Parliament's power to amend the Constitution, especially Fundamental Rights, often in the context of land reforms and the right to property.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Conflict:</strong> Article 13(2) invalidates any "law" that attempts to violate any Fundamental Right, while Article 368 empowers Parliament to amend the Constitution. Article 368 confers "Constituent power" to Parliament.</li>
                    <li><strong>Land Reforms:</strong> Issues arose from land reforms under Article 39(b) and (c) (e.g., ceiling on land ownership) clashing with the Fundamental Right to Property (via former Article 31 and Article 19(1)(f)). Courts initially struck down land reform laws for transgressing the fundamental right to property (e.g., Sir Kameshwar Singh Darbhanga v. The Province of Bihar 1950 Patna).</li>
                    <li><strong>Parliamentary Response & Judicial Scrutiny (A Timeline):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>1st Constitutional Amendment Act (1CA), 1951:</strong> Added Article 31A (no FR violated upon Govt. land acquisition) and Article 31B (creating 9th Schedule to protect certain land reform laws from judicial review).
                                <ul><li><em>Shankari Prasad v. UOI (1951):</em> SC held CA not "law" under Art 13(2); Parliament can amend any part of Constitution.</li></ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><em>Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan (1965):</em> Upheld Shankari Prasad; Parliament can amend any part, including FRs.</li>
                             <li><strong>17th Constitutional Amendment Act (17CA), 1964:</strong> Added more land laws to 9th Schedule.</li>
                            <li><em>Golak Nath v. State of Punjab (1967):</em> SC reversed earlier stance; held CA is "law" under Art 13(2); Parliament cannot amend FRs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Parliament's Reaction to Golak Nath:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>24th Constitutional Amendment Act (24CA), 1971:</strong> Amended Art 13 & 368 to explicitly state that Art 13 shall not apply to amendments made under Art 368. Declared Parliament has power to amend any part of Constitution.</li>
                                    <li><strong>25th Constitutional Amendment Act (25CA), 1971:</strong> Curtailed Right to Property; introduced Art 31C (if law implements DPSP under 39(b) or (c), it cannot be challenged for violating Art 14, 19, 31, and no judicial review if it declares it's for such DPSP).</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><em>Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973):</em> SC upheld 24CA's validity but introduced the <strong>Doctrine of Basic Structure</strong> – Parliament can amend any part of the Constitution (including FRs) but cannot alter its "basic structure" or "basic features". Art 31C's "no judicial review" clause struck down.</li>
                            <li><strong>Indira Gandhi Election Case (Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain, 1975):</strong> SC applied Basic Structure doctrine to strike down a constitutional amendment (39th CA related to election disputes).</li>
                            <li><strong>Emergency & 42nd Amendment Act (42CA), 1976 (Mini-Constitution):</strong> Amended Art 368 to state Parliament's constituent power is unlimited and no amendment can be questioned in court. Gave DPSP supremacy over FRs (Art 14, 19, 31).</li>
                            <li><em>Minerva Mills v. UOI (1980):</em> SC struck down parts of 42CA. Reaffirmed Basic Structure. Held limited amending power and judicial review are basic features. Tried to harmonize FRs & DPSPs.</li>
                            <li><em>Waman Rao v. UOI (1981):</em> Basic Structure doctrine to apply prospectively (to CAs made after Kesavananda Bharati judgment date - April 24, 1973). Amendments to 9th Schedule also subject to Basic Structure test from this date.</li>
                             <li><em>IR Coelho v. State of TN (2007):</em> Laws placed in 9th Schedule after April 24, 1973, are open to challenge if they violate FRs amounting to a violation of the Basic Structure. Judicial review of such laws is part of Basic Structure.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                     <li><strong>Relationship between FRs & DPSP:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>State of Madras v. Champakam Dorairajan (1951):</em> FRs supreme over DPSPs.</li>
                            <li><em>Re Kerala Education Bill (1957):</em> Advocated for harmonious construction between FRs & DPSPs; if conflict, FRs prevail.</li>
                            <li>Kesavananda Bharati and Minerva Mills sought to create a balance.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>


            <h3>Key Judgements Leading to Basic Structure</h3>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>A.K. Gopalan v. The State of Madras (1950):</strong> Dealt with the constitutionality of preventive detention laws. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of such laws, holding that the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Indian Constitution, including the right to life and personal liberty, were not absolute and could be curtailed by the state for reasons of national security.
            </div>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>Sri Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India and State of Bihar (1951):</strong> Dealt with the power of the Parliament to amend the Constitution. The Supreme Court held that the power to amend the Constitution under Article 368 was absolute and unfettered, and that the validity of a constitutional amendment could not be questioned on the ground that it violated any fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution. 1st CA challenged, SC held that the Parliament enjoys absolute constituent power to amend any part of the Constitution including fundamental rights as constitutional amendments were not considered 'law' as the restrictions under Art. 13(2). Constitutional scheme gave demarcation between ordinary law (exercise of legislative power) and constitutional law (exercise of constituent power).
            </div>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan (1965):</strong> Dealt with the Constitutional validity of the 17th Constitutional Amendment. The Supreme Court upholding the validity of the 17th Amendment held that the Parliament has the authority to amend any part of the Constitution including any Fundamental Rights. The Supreme Court in the Judgement even stated that if the Constitution makers intended to exclude the fundamental Right from the scope of amending power they would have made a clear provision in that behalf.
            </div>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>I.C. Golak Nath & Ors. v. State of Punjab & Anrs. (1967):</strong> Dealt with the power of the Parliament to amend the Constitution. The Supreme Court, in a landmark judgment, held that the power to amend the Constitution under Article 368 was not unlimited and that the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution could not be abrogated or abridged by a constitutional amendment.
            </div>

            <h3>The Kesavananda Bharati case (1973)</h3>
            <h4>Key legal issues:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Constitutional Validity of the Kerala Land Reforms Act:</strong> The primary legal issue in the case was the constitutional validity of the Kerala Land Reforms Act, which placed a limit on the amount of land that a person could hold and provided for the acquisition of excess land from landowners. Kesavananda Bharati argued that the Act violated his fundamental right to property, which was guaranteed by the Constitution of India.</li>
                <li><strong>The extent of the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution:</strong> Another key legal issue in the case was the extent of the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution. The question before the Supreme Court was whether the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution was unlimited or whether there were limits to this power.</li>
                <li><strong>The doctrine of basic structure of the Constitution:</strong> The Supreme Court, in its judgment, established the doctrine of basic structure of the Constitution, which holds that certain fundamental features of the Constitution, such as the supremacy of the Constitution, the rule of law, and the independence of the judiciary, cannot be amended or abrogated by the Parliament through a constitutional amendment. The question before the court was whether this doctrine was a part of the Constitution and whether the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution extended to this doctrine.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Outcome:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basic Structure Doctrine:</strong> The Supreme Court established the doctrine of basic structure, holding that there are certain fundamental features or essential elements of the Constitution that are beyond the amending power of the Parliament. The court declared that any constitutional amendment that destroys or abrogates the basic structure would be deemed unconstitutional.</li>
                <li><strong>Limits on Amending Power:</strong> The court ruled that while the Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, this power is not unlimited. The court held that there are inherent limitations on the amending power and that the Parliament cannot alter the basic structure of the Constitution.</li>
                <li><strong>Essential Features of the Constitution:</strong> The court did not provide an exhaustive list of what constitutes the basic structure, but it did identify certain features that are part of the basic structure. These features include the supremacy of the Constitution, the rule of law, judicial review, separation of powers, federalism, secularism, and protection of fundamental rights.</li>
                <li><strong>Doctrine of Prospective Overruling:</strong> The court applied the doctrine of prospective overruling, which means that the declaration of the basic structure doctrine would only apply to future amendments. The court stated that past constitutional amendments would be valid unless they affected the basic structure. (This specifically applied to Golaknath's ruling being prospectively overruled, the Basic Structure itself was applied to the amendments in question).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Application and Evolution of Basic Structure Doctrine</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Indira Gandhi vs. Raj Narain, 1975:</strong> The court used basic structure doctrine first time to strike down 39th Amendment Act (1975) provision that barred court jurisdiction over election disputes.</li>
                <li><strong>Minerva Mills Case (1980):</strong> Parliament's power to amend constitution must not damage or destroy the basic structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Waman Rao Case (1981):</strong> Basic structure doctrine will not be applicable retrospectively to laws placed in the Ninth Schedule before 24th April 1973 (Kesavananda Bharati judgment date). SC held that amendment to Constitution which was made before 24th April 1973 is valid.</li>
                <li><strong>Kihoto Hollohan vs. Zachillhu, 1992:</strong> 'Free and fair elections' was added to the basic features.</li>
                <li><strong>Indira Sawhney vs. Union of India, 1992:</strong> 'Rule of law' was added to the basic features.</li>
                <li><strong>S.R Bommai vs Union of India, 1994:</strong> Federal structure, unity and integrity of India, secularism, socialism, social justice and judicial review were reiterated as basic features.</li>
                <li><strong>IR Coelho Vs State of Tamilnadu, 2007:</strong> Constitution bench ruled that Ninth Schedule cannot be challenged for violating fundamental rights if the laws don't violate the basic structure. Laws placed in it after April 24, 1973, can be challenged for violating basic structure of Constitution.</li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Impact of Basic Structure</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Judicial Review and Constitutional Supremacy:</strong> The doctrine reinforces the principle of judicial review, granting the Indian judiciary the power to review and strike down laws that violate the basic structure of the Constitution. This ensures the supremacy of the Constitution and prevents the arbitrary exercise of power by the legislature.</li>
                <li><strong>Protecting Fundamental Rights:</strong> The doctrine of basic structure acts as a safeguard for fundamental rights enshrined in the Indian Constitution. It ensures that no constitutional amendment can dilute or abrogate these rights in a way that alters the basic structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintaining Federalism:</strong> The doctrine protects the basic structure of federalism in India. It prevents the Parliament from altering the essential features of the federal structure, such as the distribution of powers between the Union and the states, that form part of the basic structure. This has helped maintain the balance between the central government and state governments.</li>
                <li><strong>Secularism and Separation of Powers:</strong> The doctrine of basic structure upholds the principle of secularism and the separation of powers as potential basic features. It prevents any amendment that undermines the secular character of the Indian state or disturbs the delicate balance between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government if these are deemed part of the basic structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistency and Stability:</strong> The doctrine provides stability and consistency to the Indian Constitution. It ensures that the core principles and values of the Constitution remain intact over time and are not subject to frequent changes by the ruling party or the majority in Parliament if those changes affect the basic structure. This contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.</li>
                <li><strong>Limiting Constitutional Amendments:</strong> The doctrine imposes limitations on the amending power of the Parliament. While the Indian Constitution allows for amendments, the doctrine sets a boundary by prohibiting amendments that violate the basic structure. This prevents the Parliament from altering the Constitution in a manner that fundamentally transforms its character.</li>
                <li><strong>Evolution of the Constitution:</strong> The doctrine of basic structure allows for the evolution of the Indian Constitution in response to changing societal needs and aspirations. While the basic structure remains protected, the interpretation and application of the Constitution by the judiciary have allowed for progressive developments in areas such as expanding fundamental rights and inclusivity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Doctrine of Harmonious Construction</h3>
            <p>This doctrine, often referred to by courts, suggests that when interpreting different provisions of the Constitution (or statutes), an effort should be made to construe them harmoniously to avoid conflict. If two provisions seem to be in conflict, they should be interpreted in such a way that effect is given to both as far as possible. This principle was notably discussed in the context of Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy, aiming to give effect to both rather than allowing one to completely override the other, unless explicitly stated or a part of the basic structure is violated.</p>

            <h3>Way ahead for Basic Structure Doctrine</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>German Scholar Conrad in 1965 in India gave a lecture on 'Implied Limitations of Amending Power'.</li>
                <li>If Parliament can't amend, then no one can; This raises questions about ultimate sovereignty. Some suggest codifying Basic Structure, as Germany has.</li>
                <li>The foundation of Constitutionalism is the creation of a State limited by the Constitution.</li>

                <h3>Basic Structure (Revision)</h3>
                <h4>Context:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conflict between Art 13 and Art 368.</li>
                    <li>Art 13(2) invalidates any "law" violating FRs; Art 368 empowers Parliament to amend.</li>
                    <li>Art 368 confers "Constituent power".</li>
                    <li>Land Reforms under Art 39(b) & (c) vs. Right to Property (Art 31, 19(1)(f)).</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Key legal issues:</strong> Validity of Kerala Land Reforms Act, extent of Parliament's amending power, doctrine of basic structure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Established Basic Structure Doctrine; Limits on Amending Power (cannot alter basic structure); Identified some Essential Features (supremacy of Constitution, rule of law, judicial review, etc.); Applied doctrine of prospective overruling to Golaknath.</li>
                </ul>
                 <h4>Minerva Mills Case (1980):</h4>

            <h3>Keywords in Preamble</h3>
            <div class="important-box">
                <h4>SOVEREIGN</h4>
                <p>Implies that India is neither a dependency nor a dominion of any other nation[cite: 302]. There is no authority above it and it's free to conduct its own affairs[cite: 303]. Being a sovereign state India can either acquire foreign territory or cede a part of its territory[cite: 304].</p>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Membership of United Nations:</strong> Do not affect India's sovereignty and India can cut off this association at her will[cite: 305].</li>
                    <li><strong>Foreign Territories:</strong> India acquired several foreign territories such as Dadra and Nagar Haveli; Goa, Daman and Diu; Puducherry; and Sikkim since the commencement of the Constitution[cite: 306].</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="important-box">
                <h4>SOCIALIST</h4>
                <p>Indian socialism is democratic socialism, not communistic socialism[cite: 307]. Here both state and private operate and has a mixed economy[cite: 307]. Indian Socialism is a blend of Marxism and Gandhianism[cite: 308]. The term was added by the 42nd amendment in 1976 to convey that government stands with the poor[cite: 308].</p>
                <h5>Why Skipped in Original Text (BR Ambedkar believed that):</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Decision of People:</strong> Social and economic matters must be decided by people themselves according to time and circumstances[cite: 309].</li>
                    <li><strong>Respect People's Liberty:</strong> Mentioning of Nature of Socio-economic conditions would take liberty of people to decide on this aspect[cite: 309].</li>
                    <li><strong>Uphold Democracy:</strong> It cannot be laid down in the Constitution itself, because that is destroying democracy altogether[cite: 309].</li>
                    <li><strong>Changing Demands and Circumstances:</strong> It is perfectly possible today, for the majority people to hold that the socialist organisation of society is better than the capitalist organisation of society[cite: 310]. But it would be perfectly possible for thinking people to devise some other form of social organisation which might be better than the socialist organisation of today or of tomorrow[cite: 311].</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="important-box">
                <h4>SECULAR</h4>
                <p>The term means that all the religions in India get equal respect, protection and support from the state[cite: 312]. The term was added by the 42nd amendment in 1976[cite: 312]. (It was skipped in original text as Dr. BR Ambedkar believed that Indian constitution is secular in nature and it is not necessary to mention it explicitly)[cite: 313].</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Support from State:</strong> While on one hand, Government has given subsidies for Haj Yatra, It has also provided facilities for Amarnath Yatra[cite: 313].</li>
                    <li><strong>Equal Respect:</strong> Where every religion has liberty to celebrate functions like Eid, Diwali, Christmas, Guru Nanak Jayanti etc[cite: 313].</li>
                    <li><strong>Public Holidays:</strong> given to all major religious festivals[cite: 313].</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="important-box">
                <h4>DEMOCRATIC</h4>
                <p>The term implies that the Constitution of India has an established form of Constitution which gets its authority from the will of the people expressed in an election[cite: 314]. Democratic in Preamble means notably political but also social and economic democracy[cite: 314].</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Political democracy:</strong> In this, political power of the state is equally shared by citizens[cite: 315]. People are sovereign & choose their representatives through free & fair elections[cite: 316].</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Democracy:</strong> It means maintaining free market system with regulations so as to take care of the welfare needs of the citizens[cite: 317].</li>
                    <li><strong>Economic Democracy:</strong> It means everybody who contributes to the production is entitled to have his share of wages and allowance[cite: 318].</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="important-box">
                <h4>REPUBLIC</h4>
                <p>Republic implies political sovereignty lies with the people[cite: 320]. In India, the President of India is the elected head of the state[cite: 321]. It also implies the absence of any privileged class and hence public offices being open to every citizen without discrimination[cite: 322].</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Political Sovereignty with People:</strong> Once every 5 years, Head is indirectly elected by those who are chosen by people[cite: 323].</li>
                    <li><strong>Contest to President Office:</strong> Anyone with pre-specified qualifications, irrespective of class and caste, can contest for President Office[cite: 323]. It is not hereditary[cite: 323].</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Article 12: State</h3>
            <p>Article 12 provides an expansive definition of 'State,' encompassing[cite: 345]:</p>
            <ul>

            <h1>RIGHT TO EQUALITY (ARTICLE 14-18)</h1>
            <p>Right to Equality, enshrined from Article 14 to 18 in the Constitution of India, forms the cornerstone of our democratic nation, championing the principle of equality among all citizens[cite: 352]. Article 14, in particular, forbids discrimination and endorses equal protection under the law[cite: 353].</p>
            <p>Article 14 asserts that no person will be denied Equality before Law or Equal Protection of Law within Indian territory[cite: 354].</p>

            <h3>Equality before Law vs Equal Protection of Laws</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Equality before law:</strong> An idea of British origin, it negates any special privileges in favor of any person, subjects all persons to ordinary law, and affirms that no person is above the law[cite: 355, 356].</li>
                <li><strong>Equal protection of laws:</strong> An American concept, it calls for equal treatment under identical circumstances and consistent application of the same laws to all persons in similar situations[cite: 357].</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Exceptions under Article 14</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Special Provisions:</strong> The state can make special provisions for women, children, socially and economically backward classes, SCs, STs in public educational institutions as per 1st Constitutional Amendment Act, 1951[cite: 358].</li>
                <li><strong>Admission Provisions:</strong> The state can provide special provisions for backward classes, SCs, STs for admission to educational institutions including private ones except minority education institutions (93rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 2005)[cite: 358].</li>
                <li><strong>Economically Weaker Sections (EWS):</strong> The state can make special provisions for EWS, including reservations in educational institutions (103rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 2019)[cite: 359].</li>
                <li><strong>Presidential and Gubernatorial Immunities:</strong> Article 361 grants certain immunities to the President of India and the Governors of States[cite: 360].</li>
                <li><strong>Parliamentary Privileges:</strong> MPs and State Assembly members enjoy privileges and immunities under Articles 105 and 194 respectively[cite: 360].</li>
            </ul>
<h3>Reservations in India</h3>
            <p>Affirmative actions are a set of anti-discrimination measures intended to provide access to preferred positions in society to members of groups who would otherwise be excluded or under-represented[cite: 362]. Reservation is a type of affirmative action[cite: 362].</p>
            <p>The objective of reservation is to ensure social justice by giving special justice to backward classes as they were denied equal opportunity for generations & required special assistance to catch up with forward castes[cite: 363].</p>

                <li><strong>Reservation for SC, STs, OBCs:</strong> Reservation is provided to Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) at the rate of 15%, 7.5% and 27% respectively in case of direct recruitment on an all India basis by open competition[cite: 375].</li>
                <li><strong>Reservations for differently-abled:</strong> Persons with Disability Act, 1995 provides for reservation for persons with disabilities in India[cite: 376]. Under the Act, persons with disabilities got 3% reservation in both government jobs and higher educational institutions[cite: 377].</li>
                <li><strong>Economically Weaker Sections:</strong> 10% Reservation to EWS was recently provided by 103rd constitutional Amendment Act, 2019 (the year 2018 is mentioned in source, but CAA 103rd was in 2019). It amended Articles 15 and 16 to provide reservation to economically weaker sections in admission to educational institutions and government posts[cite: 378].</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Judicial Scrutiny of Reservation</h4>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>The State of Madras v. Smt. Champakam Dorairajan (1951) case:</strong> This was the first major verdict of the Supreme Court on the issue of Reservation[cite: 380, 381]. The case led to the First amendment in the constitution[cite: 381]. The Supreme Court in the case pointed out that while in the case of employment under the State, Article 16(4) provides for reservations in favor of the backward class of citizens, no such provision was made in Article 15[cite: 382]. Pursuant to the Supreme Court's order in the case the Parliament amended Article 15 by inserting Clause (4)[cite: 383].
            </div>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>Indra Sawhney v. Union of India (1992) case:</strong> The court examined the scope and extent of Article 16(4)[cite: 384]. The Court has said that the creamy layer of OBCs should be excluded from the list of beneficiaries of reservation; there should not be reservation in promotions; and total reserved quota should not exceed 50%[cite: 385]. The Parliament responded by enacting the 77th Constitutional Amendment Act which introduced Article 16(4A)[cite: 386]. The article confers power on the state to reserve seats in favor of SC and ST in promotions in Public Services if the communities are not adequately represented in public employment[cite: 387].
            </div>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>M. Nagaraj v. Union Of India (2006) case:</strong> While upholding the constitutional validity of Art 16(4A) held that any such reservation policy in order to be constitutionally valid shall satisfy the following three constitutional requirements:
                <ul>
                    <li>The SC and ST community should be socially and educationally backward[cite: 388].</li>
                    <li>The SC and ST communities are not adequately represented in Public employment[cite: 389].</li>
                    <li>Such a reservation policy shall not affect the overall efficiency in the administration[cite: 390].</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>Jarnail Singh vs Lachhmi Narain Gupta case of 2018:</strong> Supreme Court holds that reservation in promotions does not require the state to collect quantifiable data on the backwardness of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes[cite: 391]. The Court held that creamy layer exclusion extends to SC/STs and, hence the State cannot grant reservations in promotion to SC/ST individuals who belong to the creamy layer of their community[cite: 392, 393].
            </div>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>B.K Pavitra case (2019):</strong> The Supreme Court upheld the Karnataka law that allows reservations in promotions for SCs and STs with consequential seniority[cite: 394].
            </div>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>Inamdar vs. State of Maharashtra and TMA Pai Foundation vs. State of Karnataka (2005):</strong> Government cannot introduce quota in private unaided educational institutions as it was violative of Fundamental Rights under Article 19(1)(g)[cite: 395]. Government enacted 93rd constitutional amendment act to override the decision[cite: 395].
            </div>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>Ashok Kumar Thakur vs. Union of India (2008):</strong> Constitutional validity of 93rd Amendment Act was upheld by the Supreme Court[cite: 396].
            </div>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>Society for unaided private schools for Rajasthan vs. Union of India (2013):</strong> Court upheld the validity of introduction to quota under Right to Education Act, 2009 even in private unaided institutions as education was not a purely commercial commodity.
            </div>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>Mukesh Kumar v. State of Uttarakhand (2020):</strong> The Court held that Article 16 (4) and 16 (4-A) are in the nature of enabling provisions, vesting a discretion on the State Government to consider providing reservations, if the circumstances so warrant.
            </div>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>Faculty Association of AIIMS vs. Union of India (2013):</strong> In this case, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court ruled that there are certain jobs for which merit alone should be the sole criteria[cite: 397].
            </div>

            <h4>Why is reservation needed?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>To correct the historical injustice faced by backward castes in the country[cite: 399].</li>
                <li>To provide a level playing field for backward sections as they can not compete with those who have had the access of resources and means for centuries[cite: 400].</li>
                <li>To ensure adequate representation of backward classes in the services under the State[cite: 401].</li>
                <li>For advancement of backward classes[cite: 401].</li>
                <li>To ensure equality as the basis of meritocracy i.e all people must be brought to the same level before judging them on the basis of merit[cite: 402].</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Argument Against Reservation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Reservation in state services led to divisions and enmity among government employees, vitiating the atmosphere at the workplace[cite: 404].</li>
                <li>Eradication, not perpetuation of caste was the objective of the reservation policy but Caste Based Reservation has to some extent perpetuated the notion of caste in society[cite: 405].</li>
                <li>Reservation was introduced to ensure that the historically underprivileged communities were given equal access to resources but irrespective of the economic progress they continue to remain socially disadvantaged[cite: 406].</li>
                <li>Reservations goes against the principle meritocracy which is the foundation of many progressive countries[cite: 407].</li>
                <li>It has become a tool to meet narrow political ends through invoking class loyalties and primordial identities[cite: 408].</li>
                <li>The dominant and elite class within the backward castes has appropriated the benefits of reservation and the most marginalized within the backward castes have remained marginalized[cite: 409].</li>
                <li>Reservation has become the mechanism of exclusion rather than inclusion as many upper caste poors are also facing discrimination and injustice which breeds frustration in the society[cite: 410].</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Reasons Behind Increasing Demands of Reservation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Reservation is increasingly seen as a remedy for the adverse effects of ill-thought out development policies[cite: 411].</li>
                <li>In developed states like Haryana, Gujarat and Maharashtra, in spite of their economies being relatively better, three things have been worrying the people: Acute agrarian distress, Stagnation in employment growth and Distortions in the development trajectory[cite: 412]. In this backdrop, for governments, it is easier to talk of reservation than to make a course correction[cite: 412].</li>
                <li>Increasing reservation demands among upper castes also arising from the fear of losing privilege and the inability to cope with change[cite: 413].</li>
                <li>Upper castes have begun to feel disadvantaged especially in the context of government jobs as they don't get similar advantages like backward classes[cite: 414].</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Suggestions (Regarding Reservation Policy)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The reservation benefits should flow to the vast majority of underprivileged children from deprived castes; not to a few privileged children with a caste tag[cite: 415, 416].</li>
                <li>High ranking officials, families, high income professionals and others above a certain income should not get the reservation benefits especially in government jobs[cite: 417].</li>
                <li>Fair and practical ways to help needy people from each community through reservation is possible and necessary[cite: 418].</li>
                <li>The process of reservation should filter the truly economically deprived individuals and bring them all to justice.</li>
                <li>Revolutionary changes in the education system at the grass-roots level is need of the hour[cite: 419].</li>
                <li>There is also need for awareness generation because while the unreserved segments, keep on opposing the provision, the neediest sections from within the reserved segments are hardly aware about how to get benefited from the provision or even whether there are such provisions exists[cite: 420].</li>
                <li>The radical solutions like excluding the entire creamy layer among all castes from reservation and developing their capabilities instead of offering them reservation for admission to higher education or jobs on a platter[cite: 421].</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Way Forward (for Reservation Policy)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Reservation is fair, as far as it provides appropriate positive discrimination for the benefit of the downtrodden and economically backward Sections of the society[cite: 422].</li>
                <li>But when it tends to harm the society and ensures privileges to some at the cost of others for narrow political ends, it should be done away with, as soon as possible[cite: 423].</li>
                <li>The communities excluded from reservations harbour animosity and prejudice against the castes included in the reservation category.</li>
                <li>When more people aspire for backwardness rather than of forwardness, the country itself stagnates[cite: 425].</li>
                <li>Meritocracy should not be polluted by injecting relaxation of entry barriers, rather than it should be encouraged by offering financial aid to the underprivileged[cite: 426].</li>
                <li>A strong political will is indispensable to find an equilibrium between justice to the backwards, equity for the forwards and efficiency for the entire system[cite: 427].</li>
                <li>Reveal SECC Data and start a new discourse on Reservation Policy[cite: 428].</li>
                <li>In and Out Approach: Excluding those whose earlier generation has taken its benefit[cite: 429].</li>
                <li>Alternative: "National Knowledge Commission" has recommended alternatives like scholarship, free residential hostel and robust education system[cite: 430].</li>
                <li>Developmental Approach: Check new kinds of Protest from well off communities from Haryana, Gujarat and Rajasthan[cite: 431].</li>
            </ul>

                <h4>Argument Against Reservation:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Divisions and enmity among government employees[cite: 519].</li>
                    <li>Perpetuated the notion of caste in society[cite: 519].</li>
                    <li>Continue to remain socially disadvantaged[cite: 519].</li>
                    <li>Reservation destroys self-respect (Note: This point is in the revision table but not explicitly detailed in main text section against reservation).</li>
                    <li>Biggest enemy of meritocracy[cite: 519].</li>
                    <li>A tool to meet narrow political ends[cite: 519].</li>
                    <li>Dominant and elite class within the backward castes has appropriated the benefits[cite: 519].</li>
                    <li>Mechanism of exclusion rather than inclusion[cite: 519].</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Reasons Behind Increasing Demands of Reservation:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Seen as a remedy for the adverse effects[cite: 519].</li>
                    <li>Acute agrarian distress[cite: 519].</li>
                    <li>Stagnation in employment growth[cite: 519].</li>
                    <li>Distortions in the development trajectory[cite: 519].</li>
                    <li>Easier to talk of reservation than to make a course correction[cite: 519].</li>
                    <li>Fear of losing privilege[cite: 519].</li>
                    <li>Upper castes have begun to feel disadvantaged[cite: 519].</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Suggestion:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Should flow to the vast majority of underprivileged children from deprived castes[cite: 519].</li>
                    <li>High ranking officials, families, high income professionals and others above a certain income should not get the reservation[cite: 519].</li>
                    <li>Fair and practical ways[cite: 519].</li>
                    <li>Filter the truly economically deprived[cite: 519].</li>
                    <li>Changes in the education system[cite: 519].</li>
                    <li>Awareness generation[cite: 519].</li>
                    <li>Radical solutions like excluding the entire creamy layer among all castes[cite: 519].</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Way Forward:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strong political will is indispensable to find an equilibrium[cite: 519].</li>
                    <li>Reveal SECC Data and start a new discourse on Reservation Policy[cite: 519].</li>

            <h3>Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) Quota</h3>
            <p>The Supreme Court Constitutional Bench upheld the validity of the 103rd Constitutional Amendment which introduced 10% quota for EWS in education and public employment[cite: 432].</p>
            <h4>About EWS quota</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>EWS reservation was granted based on recommendations of Sinho commission (submitted report in 2010)[cite: 433].</li>
                <li>The 103rd Amendment Act 2019 inserted Articles 15(6) and 16(6) in Constitution to provide reservation to EWS among non-OBC and nonSC/ST sections of the population[cite: 434].</li>
                <li>Act enables both central and state governments to provide reservations to EWS[cite: 435]. However, decision to implement reservations for EWS in state government jobs and educational institutions rests with state governments[cite: 436].</li>
                <li>Act amended Article 15 to additionally permit the government to provide for advancement of EWS[cite: 437].</li>
                <li>Further, up to 10% of seats may be reserved for such sections for admission in educational institutions[cite: 438]. Such reservation will not apply to minority educational institutions[cite: 438].</li>
                <li>The Act also amended Article 16 to permit the government to reserve up to 10% of all posts for "EWS" of citizens[cite: 439].</li>
                <li>EWS reservation is in addition to existing reservation[cite: 439].</li>
                <li>A person not covered under reservation for SCs, STs, and OBCs, and whose family had a gross annual income below Rs 8 lakh, was to be identified as EWS for reservation[cite: 440].</li>
                <li>Also excluded were those who had five acres of agricultural land, or a residential flat of 1,000 square feet, or a residential plot of 100 square yards and above in notified municipalities, or 200 square yards in other areas[cite: 441].</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>ARTICLES AMENDED BY 103<sup>RD</sup> CAA</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Article 15 (6):</strong> It enables the government to make special provisions for the advancement of any economically weaker sections other than those already mentioned in 15 (4) and 15 (5)[cite: 442]. This relates to their admission to the educational institutions[cite: 442]. 15 (4) and 15 (5) relate to the socially and educationally backward classes or SCs/STs[cite: 443].</li>
                <li><strong>Article 16 (6):</strong> It enables the government to make special provisions for the advancement of any economically weaker sections other than those mentioned in 16 (4)[cite: 444]. This relates to promotions in appointments or post (Note: Text says "promotions in appointments or post", but 16(6) mainly concerns initial appointments/posts, not explicitly promotion for EWS like 16(4A) does for SC/ST). Article 16 (4) relates to reservation for those backward classes, which in the opinion of the state are not adequately represented in services[cite: 445].</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Significance of Judgement (EWS Quota)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reshapes politics of affirmative action:</strong> EWS quota moves the reservation discussion beyond Mandal debate (weighed in favor of caste reservation)[cite: 447]. In Ram Singh and Ors. vs Union of India case, 2015, SC suggested the need for a non-caste based identification of backward classes[cite: 448].</li>
                <li><strong>Attempt to elevate poor among general category:</strong> EWS quota provides economic justice to those who have not been the beneficiaries of affirmative action like reservation[cite: 449]. By reading caste alongside class, it reconfigures India's affirmative action policy by offering an expansive view[cite: 450].</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Concerns related to EWS quota</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reservation is for social upliftment:</strong> Reservation cannot be used as a poverty alleviation measure[cite: 451]. Poverty can be alleviated by other means like scholarships[cite: 451].</li>
                <li><strong>Violates principle of equality:</strong> By excluding OBCs, SC/ST communities from EWS, there is a clear violation of equality in their eligibility to avail of a part of the open competition opportunities[cite: 452].</li>
                <li><strong>Issue with income criteria:</strong> Income criterion of ₹8 lakh a year has already been questioned as it is liable to result in excessive coverage of socially advanced classes[cite: 453].</li>
                <li><strong>Tool of populism:</strong> Critics have raised concerns about political implications of EWS quota, highlighting its potential to exacerbate social tensions[cite: 454].</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Road Ahead (for EWS Quota)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>More detailed data and guidelines for identifying most genuine target groups is crucial to ensure that extremely needy individuals get benefit of this policy[cite: 455].</li>
                <li>Also, the government should consider both opening up the EWS quota to all communities and keeping income criterion much lower than ceiling (can be at same level as income tax slab)[cite: 456].</li>
                <li>Continuous evolution of conceptual framework is necessary to ensure that affirmative actions are increasingly inclusive in capturing backwardness[cite: 457].</li>
                <li>Policies should focus on expanding employment opportunities for EWS[cite: 458].</li>
                <li>Government should prioritize enhancing the quality of educational institutions to reduce the demand for reservations and ensure equal access for all students[cite: 458].</li>
            </ul>

<h3>Private Employment/Local reservation</h3>
            <p>Recently, the Jharkhand government has launched a job portal i.e., Jhar Niyojan portal to ensure 75% local quota in the private sector. In November 2020, the Haryana Assembly passed The Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Bill, 2020, which provided for 75 per cent reservation for local people in private sector jobs offering a monthly salary of less than Rs 30,000 (originally Rs 50,000).</p>

            <h4>Legal basis:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Article 16(3):</strong> Parliament may make a law "prescribing" a requirement of residence for jobs in a particular state. This power vests solely in the Parliament, not state legislatures.</li>
                <li><strong>Article 371 D:</strong> Andhra Pradesh under Section 371 D has powers to have "direct recruitment of local cadre" in specified areas.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Case laws:</h4>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>Dr Pradeep Jain case (1984):</strong> Court expressed an opinion that legislation for "sons of the soil would be unconstitutional.
            </div>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>Sunanda Reddy v State of Andhra Pradesh (1995):</strong> It striked down a state government policy that gave 5% extra weightage to candidates who had studied with Telugu as the medium of instruction.
            </div>

            <h4>Arguments in support of local reservation in private sector</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide right to employment: It is to protect the right to life/livelihood of people domiciled in state and to protect their health, living condition and their right to employment.</li>
                <li>Dealing with shrinking employment opportunities.</li>
                <li>Curbing selectively discriminating corporations: Employers believe the local workers lack work discipline, unwilling to learn new trades, inclined towards political and trade unions seen as pressure tactics by businesses.</li>
                <li>Address migration: it will discourage influx of migrants seeking low-paid jobs, which has a "significant impact" on local infrastructure and leads to the "proliferation of slums".</li>
                <li>Less crime rate due to meaningful engagement to youth.</li>
                <li>Boost SGDP: Reduced absenteeism and dependence on migrant labourers can boost productivity which in turn will boost state growth.</li>
                <li>Agrarian Distress: With great stress in agriculture sector across India, local people want to move away from it and seek local jobs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Arguments against local reservation in private sector</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>In contravention of Constitution: Clause providing for preference in jobs to local candidates domiciled in Haryana was in contravention of Article 14, 16 and Article 19 (1)(g).</li>
                <li>Fuels sons-of-the-soil syndrome.</li>
                <li>Stifle labour market: Such reservation may push businesses to migrate, as their skilled workforce is not sufficiently 'local'.</li>
                <li>Revival of license raj: Many experts believe that allowing reservations in private sector would be akin to nationalization of private sector and it would result in revival of license-raj.</li>
                <li>No solution to core issues: Skewed geographical development (Investors prefer to stick to States where a governance ecosystem is already in place), Low quality of education and skills.</li>
                <li>Competitiveness: Adequate skilled domestic labour may not be available which may hurt their efficiency and competitiveness. Restricts pool of candidates from which they can hire.</li>
                <li>Investment: Industries might shift their operations to other state, adversely impacting the very rationale of job creation behind such laws.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Way forward (for Local Reservation)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Bridging regional inequalities by setting up educational and skills institutions in backward areas.</li>
                <li>Promotion of labor-intensive industries to create more jobs.</li>
                <li>Providing incentives to industries for more investments and create an enabling environment for employing local people.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Sub-Categorization of OBCs</h3>
            <p>OBCs are granted 27% reservation in jobs and education under the central government but only a few affluent communities among the over 2,600 included in the Central List of OBCs have secured a major part of this. In August 2018, it was announced that the data of OBCs will also be collected in Census 2021 but there have been no other announcements after that.</p>

            <h4>Idea of sub-categorization</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>First Backward Class Commission report (1955):</strong> Proposed sub-categorization of OBCs into backward and extremely backward communities.</li>
                <li><strong>Mandal Commission report (1979):</strong> A dissent note by member L R Naik proposed subcategorization in intermediate and depressed backward classes.</li>
                <li><strong>National Commission of Backward Classes (NCBC) (2015):</strong> Proposed that OBCs be divided into the following three categories:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Extremely Backward Classes (EBC-Group A) facing social, educational and economic backwardness even within the OBCs, consisting of aboriginal tribes, nomadic and semi nomadic tribes who have been carrying on with their traditional occupations.</li>
                        <li>More Backward Classes (MBC-Group B) consisting of vocational groups carrying on with their traditional occupations.</li>
                        <li>Backward Classes (BC-Group C) comprising those comparatively more forward.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>According to NCBC, 11 states (Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Puducherry, Karnataka, Haryana, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Bihar, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu) have sub-categorized OBC for reservations in state government-owned institutions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Rohini Commission</h4>
            <p>To examine the uneven distribution of reservation benefits among different castes in the central OBC list.</p>
            <h5>Findings of Rohini commission (According to the 2018 data analysis of 1.3 lakh central jobs and admissions to central higher education institutions given under OBC quota):</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>24.95% of these jobs and seats have gone to just 10 OBC communities.</li>
                <li>97% of all jobs and educational seats have gone to just 25% of the sub-castes classified as OBCS.</li>
                <li>Representation in jobs and educational institutions; 983 OBC communities, 37% of the total, have zero representation in jobs and educational institutions.</li>
                <li>Representation in recruitments and admissions: 994 OBC sub-castes have a total representation of only 2.68% in recruitment and admissions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>According to the 2018-19 annual report of the Department of Personnel and Training, OBC recruitment in central jobs is considerably low. Number of professors in central universities: Not a single professor and associate professor appointed under the OBC quota in central universities. Posts reserved for them were being filled by people of general category as OBC candidates were declared 'None Found Suitable' (NFS).</p>

            <h3>Creamy Layer In Reservations For SC/ST</h3>
            <p>The expression 'means-test and creamy layer' first found its mention in the Supreme Court's landmark judgment in the Indra Sawhney vs Union of India case of 1992 (also known as Mandal Commission case), that was delivered by a nine-judge Bench on November 16, 1992.</p>
            <p>The creamy layer was then described as "some members of a backward class who are socially, economically as well as educationally advanced as compared to the rest of the members of that community. They constitute the forward section of that particular backward class and eat up all the benefits of reservations meant for that class, without allowing benefits to reach the truly backward members". The Court also asked the Central government to fix the norms for income, property and status for identifying the creamy layer. In 1993, the creamy layer ceiling was fixed at ₹1 lakh. It was subsequently increased to ₹2.5 lakh (2004), ₹4.5 lakh (2008), ₹6 lakh (2013), and at ₹8 lakh since 2017.</p>

            <h4>Creamy Layer Chronology</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>In 1980, the Mandal Commission report recommended to provide 27% reservation to Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in jobs.</li>
                <li>In 1990, the V P Singh Government declared such reservation of 27% in government jobs for the OBCS.</li>
                <li>In 1991, the Narasimha Rao Government introduced a change in order to give preference to the poorer sections among the OBCS while granting the 27% quota.</li>
                <li>In the Indra Sawhney judgment (1992), the Court upheld the government's move and proclaimed that the advanced sections among the OBCs (i.e, the creamy layer) must be excluded from the list of beneficiaries of reservation. It also held that the concept of creamy layer must be excluded for SCs & STs.</li>
                <li>The five-judges Bench in Nagaraj case (M. Nagaraj v. Union of India, 2006) reversed its earlier stance in Mandal case, in which it had excluded the creamy layer concept on SCs/STs (that was applicable on OBCs). The verdict in Nagaraj case made clear that even if the State has compelling reasons (as stated above), the State needs to ensure that its reservation provision does not lead to excessiveness- breaching the ceiling-limit of 50%, or destroying the creamy layer principle, or extending the reservation indefinitely. Therefore, the Court extended the creamy layer principle to SCs and STs too in this verdict, particularly for promotions.</li>
                <li>The Court in Jarnail Singh vs Lachhmi Narain Gupta case (2018) held that socially, educationally, and economically advanced cream of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes communities must be excluded from the benefits of reservation in government services in order to transfer quota benefits to the weakest of the weaker individuals and not be snatched away by members of the same class who were in the "top creamy layer". The Court also observed that it will not be possible to uplift the weaker sections if only the creamy layer within that class bags all the coveted jobs in the public sector and perpetuate themselves, leaving the rest of the class as backward as they were.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Arguments for creamy layer amongst SC/ST reservation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Creation of space:</strong> It would help leave the space for the less privileged among SC/STs.</li>
                <li><strong>Caste cannot be the sole determinant:</strong> In Balaji v/s State of Mysore, it was held that 'caste of a person cannot be the sole criteria for ascertaining whether a particular caste is backward or not'.</li>
                <li><strong>Prioritizing most marginalized:</strong> SC in Jarnail Singh Case noted that the benefits, by and large, are snatched away by the top creamy layer of the backward caste or class, keeping the weakest among the weak always weak and leaving the fortunate layers to consume the whole cake.</li>
                <li><strong>Vote Bank:</strong> Reservations seeks as a tool for mobilization.</li>
                <li><strong>Hindrance to development:</strong> They hinder the country's growth, development and competency in all aspects. Therefore, it must be rationalized.</li>
                <li><strong>Article 335:</strong> It states that Affirmative action should be subject to the overall efficiency of Public Administration. Reservation in promotions may affect the merit-based culture of the organization.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Arguments against creamy layer amongst SC/ST reservation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Precedence:</strong> It has been clearly stated in India Sawhney (1992) case, that any discussion on creamy layer "has no relevance" in the context of SC/STs.</li>
                <li><strong>Difference between OBCs and SCs:</strong> OBCs don't face the kind and extent of discrimination faced by SCs. Generally, if OBCs manage to cross a certain economic threshold, the extent of social discrimination reduces substantially.</li>
                <li><strong>Protection:</strong> The SC/STs are given job reservations not because they are poor but because they are excluded.</li>
                <li><strong>A right and not a welfare:</strong> The first part of Article 335 stipulates job reservations for SC/STs as a right of representation, not as a welfare measure.</li>
                <li><strong>Discrimination within service:</strong> For example, there are about 12,000 cases lying with the SC/ST Commission, complaining about discrimination in service.</li>
                <li><strong>False notion of efficiency:</strong> 'loss in efficiency' argument is result of an extremely conservative understanding of merit. No person can be promoted unless they obtain a good rating in annual confidential report - current measure of efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Therefore, Reservation provides appropriate positive discrimination for the benefit of the socially and educationally backward sections of the society. And the creamy layer concept helps in ensuring that only the genuinely deserving and the most downtrodden members of any particular community get those reservation benefits.</p>

            <h3>Right To Free Speech</h3>
            <p>Recently, Supreme Court ruled that no additional restrictions other than those which are permissible under Article 19(2) of Indian constitution can be imposed on free speech of public functionaries.</p>
            <h4>SC held that:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A statement made by a minister, even in official capacity, cannot be attributed vicariously to the government by invoking the principle of collective responsibility.</li>
                <li>Under Article 75 (3) and 164 (2), the Council of Ministers (CoM) is collectively responsible to the House of People and the Legislative Assembly of State respectively.</li>
                <li>SC stated that collective responsibility flows from CoM to individual ministers, not on reverse, namely, from individual Ministers to CoM.</li>
                <li>Fundamental right under Article 19, 21 can be enforced even against persons other than state or its instrumentalities.</li>
                <li>A mere statement made by a minister, inconsistent with rights of a citizen, may not become actionable as constitutional tort. But if it leads to an act of omission or commission by a public official then it is a constitutional tort.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Constitutional tort is a violation of one's constitutional rights, particularly fundamental rights, by an agent of government, acting in his/her official capacity. A court of law can award monetary compensation to the victim in such a case.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>About Free Speech</h4>
            <p>Free speech is the legal right to express or seek out ideas and opinions freely without fear of censorship or legal action.</p>
            <p>Universal Declaration of Human Rights under Article 19 states that everyone has right to express their opinions freely, in whichever way they want.</p>

            </div>

            <h4>Need of Free Speech</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Media and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) reporting on pressing issues shape public perception and enhance government accountability.</li>
                <li><strong>Active participation:</strong> Free speech supports FRs like freedom of assembly, empowering citizens to influence public decision-making through protests and demonstrations.</li>
                <li><strong>Promotes equality:</strong> Campaigning and openly addressing community issues can bring them to forefront, gain public support, and halt human rights abuses.</li>
                <li><strong>Necessary for change and innovation:</strong> Free speech protects creative license of artists and allows them to develop and share ideas freely. These can be academic writings, theatre, cartoons, visual arts etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Development:</strong> Freedom of speech is crucial for freedom of thought as exposure to diverse ideas allows for independent perspectives and meaningful discussions.</li>
                <li><strong>Building block:</strong> Free speech forms a foundation for other rights granted to citizens, such as freedom of press which helps in inculcate a better-informed public and electorate.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Need of Restrictions (under Article 19(2))</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sovereignty and integrity:</strong> Constitution (Sixteenth Amendment) Act, 1963 added Article 19(2) to restrict speech threatening India or instigating secessionist movements.</li>
                <li><strong>Security of State</strong> is of utmost importance and imposing reasonable restrictions on activities risking security of the nation is of vital importance.</li>
                <li><strong>Friendly relations with foreign States:</strong> To curb malicious actions, to jeopardize the reputation of country and to maintain positive relations with other countries in a globalized world.</li>
                <li><strong>Public order, decency, or morality:</strong> To prevent marketing or distribution of explicit content in public places, causing social unrest or discomfort to society.</li>
                <li><strong>Contempt of court:</strong> To maintain stature and preserve public trust in the judiciary. It is punishable under Article 129 and Article 215 by SC and HC respectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Defamation or incitement to an offence:</strong> First Amendment Act of 1951 added a provision clarifying that freedom of speech doesn't permit incitement of offense or communal violence.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Way forward (for Free Speech)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Arbitrariness:</strong> Reasonable restrictions under Article 19(2) should avoid arbitrariness and excessiveness, striking a balance between freedoms and social control.</li>
                <li><strong>Nature of restriction:</strong> In assessing reasonableness, Court should consider the nature of restriction and prescribed enforcement procedures on the individual freedom before arriving at a verdict.</li>
                <li><strong>Education</strong> can help in development of understanding of free speech and promote its usefulness such as protection of rights of minorities, women empowerment, transparency in governance etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Awareness:</strong> Public authorities, NGO, CSO etc. can help in promoting awareness with respect to free speech.</li>
            </ul>
<h3>Sedition In India</h3>
            <p>Sedition is defined as an offense committed when any person brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards the government. There has been 28% increase in the number of sedition cases between 2014 and 2020 [Art 14 Research].</p>

            <h4>Advantages of Sedition Law</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>National Security:</strong> It enables the state to effectively deal with insurgent groups and those who may pose debilitative threats to the security.</li>
                <li><strong>Stability of State:</strong> It also gives enough protection against any anti-national activity or violent overthrow of the elected government.</li>
                <li><strong>Sensitive social fabric:</strong> The law deters groups trying to create animosity or disharmony in the country.</li>
                <li><strong>Non state actors:</strong> It helps deter any individual seeking to bring down the elected government or have any terrorist intention.</li>
                <li><strong>Preventive:</strong> The provisions of the act deter any person seeking to engage in anti-state activities.</li>
                <li><strong>Left-Wing Extremist:</strong> It is an effective tool to fight insurgency in the Maoist hit regions within India.</li>
                <li><strong>Curbs sensational movements:</strong> It is also effective against groups seeking independence from India. Example: Khalistan groups, ULFA in Assam.</li>
                <li><strong>Protects Public Sentiment:</strong> It enables the state to take action against those who stir public emotion and instigate riots and disorder.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Law Commission of India recommendation on Sedition</h4>
            <p>The Law Commission of India recommended retaining the provision for Sedition under Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.</p>
            <h5>Justifications:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Growth of social media has played a role in propagating radical thoughts against India, often instigated and facilitated by 'adversarial foreign powers'.</li>
                <li>Restrictions of 'public order', and 'incitement to an offence' fall within the ambit of Sedition law.</li>
                <li>Without the sedition law, individuals involved in seditious activities could potentially be prosecuted under special laws, which often carry more stringent provisions.</li>
                <li>'Colonial legacy' is not a strong enough basis for removal.</li>
                <li>In countries where sedition laws have been struck down, other laws addressing seditious activities have been incorporated within their treason and counter-terrorism laws.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Need for Reform of Sedition Law</h4>
            <h5>Political Concerns:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Political Misuse:</strong> It is prone to be misused by the state against any critic or opposition.</li>
                <li><strong>Draconian:</strong> The law is a product of colonial India and thus its premise and logic are no longer valid in democratic and independent India.</li>
                <li><strong>Curbs healthy democracy:</strong> Sedition law hits hard at the open speech, one of the key pillars of a healthy democracy.</li>
                <li><strong>Breach of International conventions:</strong> India has ratified various Interaction covenants on civil and human rights, thus the sedition law does not conform with the clause to uphold free speech.</li>
                <li><strong>Poor Democratic Credentials:</strong> Frequent use of this law which has Colonial origins curbs opposition and criticism in a nation and thus in the long run questions our democratic credentials.</li>
                <li><strong>Reflects poorly on state apparatus:</strong> It portrays a very weak and feeble foundation of the elected government which is easily rattled by criticism and threat.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Judicial Concerns:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Low Conviction Rates:</strong> It has very low conviction rates (3.3% in 2019 NCRB Data) and seen as overkill, however it causes ill repute and loss of dignity to even the accused.</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple Interpretations:</strong> The terms defining sedition are not defined properly and are vague, the term disaffection is defined as promoting enmity, the meaning of which is unclear.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Social/Individual Concerns:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Impacts whistle-blowers:</strong> Whistle-blowers who bring out essential information regarding illegal activities may be deterred by this act.</li>
                <li><strong>Curbs freedom:</strong> It can effectively curb the fundamental right to free speech as dissent may be misconstrued as sedition.</li>
                <li><strong>Societal Stigma:</strong> Even those accused and not proven guilty are often prone to violence and shaming by others in the society and thus tarnishes the image of individuals.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Judicial Pronouncements on Sedition</h4>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>Tara Singh v State of Punjab (1950):</strong> In this case, the court held the section as unconstitutional as it was against the freedom of speech and expression.
            </div>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>Ram Nandan v State of UP(1958):</strong> The Allahabad HC held that Section 124A imposed restrictions on the freedom of speech which was not in the interest of the people.
            </div>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>Kedarnath v State of Bihar (1962):</strong> The Supreme Court observed that the sedition law must be narrowly interpreted. (It upheld its constitutionality but limited its scope to acts involving intention or tendency to create disorder, or disturbance of law and order, or incitement to violence).
            </div>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>Balwant Singh and Another v State of Punjab (1995):</strong> The SC held that the casual raising of slogans once or twice by two individuals cannot be termed as Sedition.
            </div>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>Shreya Singhal v Union of India (2015):</strong> The Supreme Court clearly drew distinction between "Advocacy" and "incitement", in which only incitement can be punished.
            </div>

                <strong>S.G. Vombatkere v Union of India (2022):</strong> Ordered a halt on all proceedings and registering of fresh cases, granted the Union time to re-examine the law.
            </div>

            <h4>Way Forward for Sedition Law</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Distinction in crimes:</strong> Sedition cases arising from speech must be distinguished from those arising from seditious activities.</li>
                <li><strong>Burden of Proof:</strong> The burden of proof must be upon those who claim to feel violated by the alleged seditious acts or speech.</li>
                <li><strong>Leniency:</strong> It should at-least be made a bailable offense, due to low conviction rates and high pendency it should not be used as a way to harass a dissenter.</li>
                <li><strong>Police Awareness:</strong> The police officer must understand that sedition no longer means merely exciting "disaffection" against the government.</li>
                <li><strong>Application with Caution:</strong> The use must be restricted only to genuine cases and with caution as it is prone to be misused.</li>
                <li><strong>Penal Action on Frivolous complaints:</strong> Penal action must be taken against those who make false allegations only to harass others.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Cognizable:</strong> The offenses should be made non-cognisable so that there is at least a judicial check on politically motivated complaints.</li>
                <li><strong>Multi Stakeholder Committee:</strong> Forming a committee involving Government and renowned civil society members while deciding cases.</li>
                <li><strong>Bailable Exception:</strong> All speech-related offenses should be made bailable offenses.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Hate Speech</h3>
            <p>Supreme Court asked governments of NCT of Delhi, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh to take suo motu action against any hate speech crimes taking place within their jurisdiction. There is no specific legal definition of 'hate speech' in India.</p>
            <p>Law Commission (LC), in its 267th Report, defined hate speech as an incitement to hatred primarily against a group of persons defined in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religious belief etc.</p>

            <h4>Legislations around Hate speech</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Constitutional Provision:</strong> Article 19(2) gives all citizens the right to freedom of speech and expression but subject to 'reasonable restrictions for preserving inter 'alia' public order, decency or morality'.</li>
                <li><strong>Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860:</strong> Sections like 153A, 153B, 298 etc. of IPC 1860 deal with speech or words that could create mischief, outrage religious beliefs or cause imputations to national integration.</li>
                <li><strong>Representation of People Act, 1951:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Section 8 disqualifies a person from contesting election if he is convicted for indulging in acts amounting to illegitimate use of freedom of speech and expression.</li>
                        <li>Section 123(3A) and section 125 prohibits promotion of enmity on grounds of religion, race, caste, community, or language in connection with election as a corrupt electoral practice and prohibits it.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955:</strong> Section 7 penalises incitement to, and encouragement of untouchability through words, either spoken or written, or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Important judicial pronouncements in context of Hate speech</h4>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>State Of Karnataka And Anr vs Dr. Praveen Bhai Thogadia, 2004:</strong> SC held that state or the district authorities were well within their rights to prohibit entry so that one does not make speeches, which creates public order issue.
            </div>

            </div>

            <h4>Issues with Hate speech</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Hate speech fuels discrimination, marginalization, and unfair treatment by reinforcing stereotypes and prejudices, leading to social exclusion and denied opportunities for certain individuals or groups.</li>
                <li>It affects individuals' overall psychological health by inducing stress, anxiety, depression, damaging self-esteem, sense of belonging.</li>
                <li>Incite individuals or groups to commit acts of violence against targeted individuals or communities.</li>
                <li>Balancing freedom of speech and countering hate speech requires careful legislation and enforcement to address harm without suppressing expression.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Suggestions to tackle hate speech</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>LC has proposed two new sections, Section 153C and Section 505A in IPC to criminalize hate speech specifically.</li>

                <li>Implementing a robust code of conduct is essential for media agencies like You Tube, Twitter, and Facebook to effectively curb hate speech.</li>
                <li>Promoting empathy, fostering diversity, and strengthening legal frameworks to combat hate speech are important for fostering an inclusive and tolerant society.</li>
            </ul>
           <h3>Information Technology Amendment Rules, 2023</h3>
            <p>Recently, the Bombay High Court has said the IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Amendment Rules, 2023 does not seem to offer protection to fair criticism of the government through parody or satire[cite: 661]. The IT Rules derives the authority from the Information Technology Act, 2000, which gives legal recognition to electronic commerce in India[cite: 662].</p>

            <h4>Information Technology Amendment Rules, 2023 - Key Provisions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Obligatory for Intermediaries:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>No platform can allow harmful unapproved online games and their advertisements[cite: 663].</li>
                        <li>They should not share false information about the Indian government, as confirmed by a fact-checking unit[cite: 664].</li>
                        <li>An online intermediary - including social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter and internet service providers like Airtel, Jio and Vodafone Idea - should make "reasonable efforts" to not host content related to the Central Government that is "identified as fake or misleading" by a "fact check unit" that may be notified by the IT Ministry[cite: 665].</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Self-Regulatory Bodies:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Platforms providing online gaming will have to register with a Self-Regulatory Body (SRB) that will determine whether or not the game is "permissible." [cite: 666]</li>
                        <li>The platform should ensure that online games do not involve any gambling or betting elements[cite: 667]. They should also comply with legal requirements, standards, and safety precautions such as parental controls[cite: 667].</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Losing Safe Harbour:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If any piece of information is marked as fake by the upcoming fact check unit, intermediaries will be required to take it down, failing which they would risk losing their safe harbour, which protects them from litigation against third-party content[cite: 669].</li>
                        <li>Social media sites will have to take down such posts, and internet service providers will have to block URLs of such content[cite: 670].</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key IT Rules, 2021 (Context)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mandates social media to Exercise Greater Diligence:</strong> Broadly, the IT Rules (2021) mandate social media platforms to exercise greater diligence with respect to the content on their platforms[cite: 671].</li>
                <li><strong>Ensuring Online Safety and Dignity of Users:</strong> Intermediaries shall remove or disable access within 24 hours of receipt of complaints of contents that exposes the private areas of individuals, show such individuals in full or partial nudity or in sexual act or is in the nature of impersonation including morphed images etc. [cite: 672]</li>
                <li><strong>Educating Users about the Privacy Policies:</strong> The privacy policies of the social media platforms must ensure that users are educated about not circulating copyrighted material and anything that can be construed as defamatory, racially or ethnically objectionable, paedophilic, threatening the unity, integrity, defence, security or sovereignty of India or friendly relations with foreign states, or violative of any contemporary law[cite: 673].</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Concerns regarding IT Amendment Rules, 2023</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Clear Definition:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The amendment fails to define fake news and allows the government's fact-check unit to declare the veracity of any news "in respect of any business" that involves the state[cite: 674].</li>
                        <li>The use of undefined words, especially the phrase "any business", gives the government unchecked power to decide what people can see, hear, and read on the internet[cite: 675].</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>No clarity for Fake News:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The IT Rules, 2023 don't specify what qualifies as false or misleading information or the qualifications and procedures for the fact-check unit[cite: 677].</li>
                        <li>This has raised concerns about the government's arbitrary power to determine what qualifies as fake news, as the rules do not provide a clear definition of the term[cite: 678].</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Removable of Information:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Intermediaries will remove information deemed false by the Fact Check Unit, leaving only the state to determine what is true[cite: 679].</li>
                        <li>The new regulation gives the government the power to decide what information is bogus and exercise censorship by compelling intermediaries to take down posts deemed fake or false[cite: 680].</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Violates the Supreme Court's Judgment:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Shreya Singhal vs Union of India (2015), Supreme Court held that a law that limits speech can neither be vague nor over-broad[cite: 681].</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Way Forward (for IT Rules)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>To combat misinformation and fake news, the government and intermediaries can use technology solutions like algorithms and fact-checking websites[cite: 682].</li>
                <li>Intermediaries can also implement self-regulatory measures such as monitoring content and working with fact-checking websites[cite: 683].</li>
                <li>Additionally, raising public awareness about the dangers of censorship and promoting free speech can be achieved through social media campaigns, workshops, and discussions in public forums[cite: 684].</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Right to Protest</h3>
            <p>In terms of international law, the rights to freedom of association, peaceful assembly and expression are recognized in various treaties, including the international covenant on civil and political rights[cite: 685]. Together, these rights constitute the right to protest[cite: 685].</p>

            <h4>Justification for Right to Protest</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>It is the right of every citizen to freely elect their government and when dissatisfied with its performance, to vote it out of power in a legitimately held election (Article 326)[cite: 687].</li>
                <li>Any form of public action to challenge the government's proposals or decisions is also constitutionally legitimate, as long as it is done peacefully[cite: 688].</li>
                <li>Any arbitrary restraint on the exercise of such rights shows the inability of the government to tolerate dissent, but protest cannot be illegitimate too[cite: 689].</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Constitutional scheme, constitutional spirit behind Right to Protest</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The right to protest involves the exercise of two fundamental rights: freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution and the freedom to assemble peacefully under 19(1)(b)[cite: 690].</li>
                <li>Both the rights mentioned above are subject to reasonable restrictions under 19(2) and 19(3) on grounds such as sovereignty and integrity of India, and public order[cite: 691].</li>
                <li>Resorting to violence during the protest is a violation of a key fundamental duty of citizens[cite: 692]. Enumerated in Article 51A, the Constitution makes it a fundamental duty of every citizen "to safeguard public property and to abjure violence"[cite: 693].</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Why should there be Protest in Democracy?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Historically, protests have often inspired positive social change and the advancement of human rights, and they continue to help define and protect civic space in all parts of the world[cite: 694].</li>
                <li>Protests encourage the development of an engaged and informed citizenry[cite: 695].</li>
                <li>They strengthen representative democracy by enabling direct participation in public affairs[cite: 696].</li>
                <li>They enable individuals and groups to express dissent and grievances, to share views and opinions, to expose flaws in governance and to publicly demand that the authorities and other powerful entities rectify problems and are accountable for their actions[cite: 697].</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Government Response to Protest (Examples)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Accusation of Foreign Infiltration like support of Khalistani groups to the Farmer Protest[cite: 698].</li>
                <li>Slapping UAPA, considering Protest as National security concern.</li>
                <li>Using water cannons, batons, and tear gas.</li>
                <li>Protesting farmers are dubbed as "Leftist and Maoist" and being "hijacked" by unknown conspirators[cite: 700].</li>
                <li>Blocking of Internet.</li>
                <li>In some States like UK, Bihar, Police watching social media posts for "anti-national" posts and that passport applications could be denied to anyone who had posted such content[cite: 701].</li>
                <li>Barricades and barbed wire and even planted spikes to check the Protest movement.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="important-box">
                <h4>Note: How does UAPA violate Fundamental Rights?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>It allows a central government to name any individual as Terrorist, and the name of such person will be included in the Fourth Schedule of the act and that can be denotified only by a Review Committee constituted by the government itself[cite: 703].</li>
                    <li>An official designation as a terrorist will be akin to "civil death" of an individual[cite: 704].</li>
                    <li>Wide ambit that includes Writer, author, lawyers anyone.</li>
                    <li>Non Bailable is against the rule of Bail is a rule and jail are an exception[cite: 705].</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>SC on Right to Protest</h4>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>Ramlila Maidan Incident vs Home Secretary, Union of India (2012):</strong> The Supreme Court held that citizens have a fundamental right to assembly and peaceful protest which cannot be taken away by an arbitrary executive or legislative action[cite: 706].
            </div>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS) vs Union of India (2018):</strong> In this case, SC upheld the fundamental right to assembly and peaceful protest but ordered it to be regulated in such a way that they do not cause inconvenience to residents from Jantar Mantar Road or the offices located there[cite: 707].
            </div>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>Shaheen Bagh Judgement:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The court upheld the right to peaceful protest against a law but made it clear that public ways and public spaces cannot be occupied and that too indefinitely[cite: 708].</li>
                    <li>The right to protest in a public place should be balanced with the right of the general public to move freely without hindrance[cite: 710].</li>
                    <li>Fundamental rights do not live in isolation. The right of the protester has to be balanced with the right of the commuter and has to co-exist in mutual respect[cite: 711].</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>Devangana Kalita vs State; Natasha Narwal vs State:</strong> The bench commented that "the right to protest is not outlawed and cannot be termed as a 'terrorist act' within the meaning of the UAPA"[cite: 712].
            </div>

            <h4>Conclusion (on Right to Protest)</h4>
            <p>India has been a country of non-violence and civil disobedience, with the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi gaining popularity with each passing day[cite: 713]. Thus, any protest which promotes violence and instigates people in any form is illegal and unethical in the Indian context[cite: 714].</p>
            <h3>Right to Movement</h3>
            <p>Article 19 (1)(d) under Part III of the constitution deals with the fundamental right to freedom of movement. It guarantees the citizens of India the right to move freely throughout the territory of India. This right overlaps with Article 19(1)(e) which talks about the right to freely reside in any part of the country. The word "freely" connotes "without any absolute restriction". Wherever and however, one likes, he can move without any restriction. It is subject to reasonable restrictions mentioned under Article 19(5), which states that states can impose restrictions on the freedom of movement of people either in the interest of the general public or for the protection of rights of the scheduled tribes.</p>

            <h4>Court Observation on Right to Movement</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Kharak Singh vs State of UP:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unreasonable surveillance and domiciliary visits by police not authorised by any law and thus held to be violative of the right to freedom of movement.</li>
                        <li>The Court observed that even psychological restraint of freedom of movement is violative of this Article.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The State of Uttar Pradesh vs Kaushaliya:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Restrictions on the free movement imposed on prostitutes to carry on their trade within a specified area and to reside in or move from particular areas have been held to be valid.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Recent Observation on Restrictions to Movement</h4>
            <p>The provisions for providing the power of externment to the concerned executive authorities can be found in many statutes such as The Maharashtra Police Act (MP 1951), Punjab Security of State Act 1953, and Assam Right to Movement Maintenance of Public Order Act 1947, Karnataka Police Act.</p>
            <p>The pandemic has brought many restrictions in our ordinary life. From restricting our movement via imposed lockdowns to freedom of expression and assembly. Public gatherings, restaurants, malls, etc. were put to close, especially during the early period of the pandemic. Restriction on freedom of movement is put by the order passed by the government under Section 144 of CrPC along with the Epidemic Disease Act.</p>

            <h3>Rights in Digital Age</h3>
            <p>Digital rights are basically human rights in the internet era. The rights to online privacy and freedom of expression, for example, are really extensions of the equal and inalienable rights laid out in the United Nations UDHR. According to the UN, disconnecting people from the internet Violates these rights and goes against international law.</p>

            <h4>Internet Shutdowns In India</h4>
            <p>An internet shutdown is an intentional disruption of the internet, making it inaccessible for a specific population or within a location, often to exert control over the flow of information.</p>

<h4>Data Sovereignty</h4>
            <p>Digital sovereignty refers to the ability to have control over your own digital destiny - the data, hardware and software that you rely on and create. It has become a concern for many policy-makers who feel there is too much control ceded to too few places, too little choice in the tech market, and too much power in the hands of a small number of large tech companies.</p>

            <h5>Current Government Policy on Digital Sovereignty</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Meity has envisaged the need for building State Data Centre (SDC) as the part of core infrastructure development, and as a key supporting element for supporting the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP).</li>
                <li>The cloud providers have been asked to place an "e-discovery" system to allow search and retrieval of data stored in the cloud, and this system can be accessed only by a government entity.</li>
                <li>Meity mandates data encryption as a "standard security process" for all sensitive and confidential data maintained by the government in the cloud.</li>
                <li>Meity has asked the cloud provider to report any incidence of unauthorized access of data, security breaches, and intrusions, either by government employee or by the cloud provider.</li>
                <li>Information stored on the cloud should not be published or advertised by the cloud provider to any person or organization without permission from the government entity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Suggestion (for Data Sovereignty)</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The government should facilitate a partnership among the State, domestic companies, and international technology firms.</li>
                <li>And, India can leverage initiatives such as Quad to build safe digital corridors through which it can engage with, harness and eventually lead global markets and societies.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Politics of Free Speech, Freedom of Press & Regulation</h3>
            <p>The Indian news press enjoys the freedom to engage in the business of disseminating news under Article 19(1)(g). Complications arise when Article 19(1)(a) of free speech and Article 19(1)(g) of free conduct of business are read to be one and the same and even the oversight and restrictions in the interest of the 'general public' contemplated under Article 19(6) are ignored because of this obfuscation.</p>

            <div class="important-box">
                <h4>Note: Freedom of Press</h4>
                <p>Freedom of press has three essential elements. They are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Freedom of access to all sources of information,</li>
                    <li>Freedom of publication, and</li>
                    <li>Freedom of circulation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Hon'ble Supreme Court in <em>Union of India v/s Association for Democratic Reforms</em> observed that, "One-sided information, disinformation, misinformation and non-information, all equally create an uninformed citizenry which makes democracy a farce."</p>
            </div>

            <h4>Why Freedom of Press comes under Scanner?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Handful ownership of Media:</strong> As per the reports of Data Leads and Reporters Without Borders, most of the Indian media houses are owned/controlled by politically affiliated people.</li>
                <li><strong>Hyper commercialization and Price war.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Media's reliance on spectacle, simplification and exaggeration</strong> to grab and hold audiences.</li>
                <li><strong>Steady growth of Pseudo scribes</strong> who take to journalism to gain access to power, position and institutions.</li>
                <li><strong>Sex and Nudity:</strong> (Often used sensationalist content to attract viewership, sometimes crossing lines of decency).</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of Integrity and Impartiality.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>The problem of hate speech</strong> is compounded when propagated by members of the press. Example: attacks on Umar Khalid, activists arrested in relation to the Bhima Koregaon incident, etc.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Regulation of Media in India:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Press Council of India:</strong> Power to receive complaints of violation of the journalistic ethics, or professional misconduct by an editor or journalist.</li>
                <li><strong>Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC):</strong> For screening films in theaters or broadcasting via television the CBFC sanction is required.</li>
                <li><strong>The Cable Television Network (Regulation) Act, 1995:</strong> content code / Advertisement code for programmes and advertisements appearing in cable TV Network.</li>
                <li><strong>The News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA),</strong> of the NBA, is empowered to warn, admonish, censure, express disapproval and fine the broadcaster a sum up to Rs. 1 lakh for violation of the Code.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="important-box">
                <h4>Note: Why is there a need to regulate electronic media?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Will bring a level playing field for all kinds of digital players running independent news digital organizations.</li>
                    <li>Will also provide a kind of credence to digital platforms of all shapes and sizes.</li>
                    <li>Recognition of independent journalism not only by the government but various other arms of the government at state and central level.</li>
                    <li>Will be able to bring some kind of difference between serious and non-serious news providers.</li>
                    <li>Will help in identification of the source. Example: The news disseminated by the WhatsApp of Facebook could be cross checked by the digital content of the registered website.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Present law and rule for regulation of electronic media:</h4>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Section 69(1) of the Information Technology Act, 2000.</li>
                    <li>Section 79 of IT Act.</li>
                 </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Conclusion (on Media Regulation):</h4>
            <p>In the words of Judge Pillay, 'the power of the media to create and destroy fundamental human values comes with great responsibility. Those who control such media are accountable for its consequences.'</p>

Complications arise when Article 19(1)(a) of free speech and Article 19(1)(g) of free conduct of business are read to be one and the same and even the oversight and restrictions in the interest of the 'general public' contemplated under Article 19(6) are ignored because of this obfuscation.</p>

            <div class="important-box">
                <h4>Note: Freedom of Press</h4>
                <p>Freedom of press has three essential elements. They are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Freedom of access to all sources of information,</li>
                    <li>Freedom of publication, and</li>
                    <li>Freedom of circulation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Hon'ble Supreme Court in <em>Union of India v/s Association for Democratic Reforms</em> observed that, "One-sided information, disinformation, misinformation and non-information, all equally create an uninformed citizenry which makes democracy a farce."</p>
            </div>

            <h4>Why Freedom of Press comes under Scanner?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Handful ownership of Media:</strong> As per the reports of Data Leads and Reporters Without Borders, most of the Indian media houses are owned/controlled by politically affiliated people.</li>
                <li><strong>Hyper commercialization and Price war.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Media's reliance on spectacle, simplification and exaggeration</strong> to grab and hold audiences.</li>
                <li><strong>Steady growth of Pseudo scribes</strong> who take to journalism to gain access to power, position and institutions.</li>
                <li><strong>Sex and Nudity:</strong> (Often used sensationalist content to attract viewership, sometimes crossing lines of decency).</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of Integrity and Impartiality.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>The problem of hate speech</strong> is compounded when propagated by members of the press. Example: attacks on Umar Khalid, activists arrested in relation to the Bhima Koregaon incident, etc.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Regulation of Media in India:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Press Council of India:</strong> Power to receive complaints of violation of the journalistic ethics, or professional misconduct by an editor or journalist.</li>
                <li><strong>Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC):</strong> For screening films in theaters or broadcasting via television the CBFC sanction is required.</li>
                <li><strong>The Cable Television Network (Regulation) Act, 1995:</strong> content code / Advertisement code for programmes and advertisements appearing in cable TV Network.</li>
                <li><strong>The News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA),</strong> of the NBA, is empowered to warn, admonish, censure, express disapproval and fine the broadcaster a sum up to Rs. 1 lakh for violation of the Code.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="important-box">
                <h4>Note: Why is there a need to regulate electronic media?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Will bring a level playing field for all kinds of digital players running independent news digital organizations.</li>
                    <li>Will also provide a kind of credence to digital platforms of all shapes and sizes.</li>
                    <li>Recognition of independent journalism not only by the government but various other arms of the government at state and central level.</li>
                    <li>Will be able to bring some kind of difference between serious and non-serious news providers.</li>
                    <li>Will help in identification of the source. Example: The news disseminated by the WhatsApp of Facebook could be cross checked by the digital content of the registered website.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Present law and rule for regulation of electronic media:</h4>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Section 69(1) of the Information Technology Act, 2000.</li>
                    <li>Section 79 of IT Act.</li>
                 </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Conclusion (on Media Regulation):</h4>
            <p>In the words of Judge Pillay, 'the power of the media to create and destroy fundamental human values comes with great responsibility. Those who control such media are accountable for its consequences.'</p>

            <h1>RIGHT TO LIFE & LIBERTY (ARTICLE 21)</h1>
            <p>Article 21 of the Constitution states: "No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law." This fundamental right is available to both citizens and non-citizens.</p>

            <h4>Meaning and Scope of 'Life' and 'Personal Liberty'</h4>
            <p>The Supreme Court has given a very wide and expansive interpretation to the terms 'life' and 'personal liberty'.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>'Life' in Article 21 is not merely animal existence or physical survival. It means the right to live with human dignity and all that goes along with it.</li>
                <li>It includes all aspects that make life meaningful, complete, and worth living. This encompasses rights such as the right to livelihood, privacy, shelter, health, education, and a clean environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Maneka Gandhi vs. Union of India (1978)</strong> was a landmark case that significantly broadened the scope of Article 21.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Court overruled its earlier stance in the A.K. Gopalan case.</li>
                        <li>It held that the 'procedure established by law' under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable, not arbitrary, fanciful, or oppressive. If the procedure is arbitrary, the law itself would be violative of Article 21.</li>
                        <li>This judgment implicitly introduced the American concept of "substantive due process of law" into Article 21.</li>
                        <li>The Court also held that the right to travel abroad is a part of 'personal liberty' under Article 21.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Right to Personal Liberty and Reasonable 'procedure established by law'</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>A.K. Gopalan vs. State of Madras (1950):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Supreme Court initially took a narrow and literal interpretation of Article 21.</li>
                        <li>It held that 'personal liberty' meant only liberty relating to the person or body of the individual (freedom from arrest and detention).</li>
                        <li>'Procedure established by law' was interpreted to mean a law duly enacted by the legislature is a valid procedure, irrespective of its reasonableness or fairness. The court would not examine if the law itself was reasonable.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Shift after Maneka Gandhi case:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The procedure prescribed by law for depriving a person of their right to life and personal liberty must be "right, just, and fair" and not "arbitrary, fanciful, or oppressive."</li>
                        <li>If the procedure is arbitrary or unreasonable, it would not be a procedure at all and the requirement of Article 21 would not be satisfied.</li>
                        <li>This means that a law that prescribes a procedure for depriving a person of personal liberty has to meet the requirements of Articles 14 and 19 as well. The procedure must be reasonable.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Right to Live in Healthy Environment is part of Right to Life and Personal Liberty</h3>
            <p>The Supreme Court has expanded Article 21 to include the right to a healthy and pollution-free environment as an essential part of the right to life.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra vs. State of U.P. (Dehradun Quarrying Case):</strong> The Court recognized the right to live in a healthy environment with minimal disturbance of ecological balance as part of Article 21.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India (Oleum Gas Leak Case and others):</strong> The Court repeatedly emphasized the right to live in a pollution-free environment as a fundamental right under Article 21.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Vellore Citizens Welfare Forum vs. Union of India:</strong> The Court held that principles like Sustainable Development, the Precautionary Principle, and the Polluter Pays Principle are part of the environmental law of the country, implicitly strengthening the right to a healthy environment.
                </li>
                <li>Other environmental rights recognized by the Supreme Court under Article 21 include the right to clean air, clean water, and protection against hazardous industries.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Right to Privacy is Part of Right to Life and Personal Liberty</h3>
            <p>The journey of the Right to Privacy as a fundamental right has seen significant evolution through judicial pronouncements.</p>
            <h4>Evolution:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>M.P. Sharma vs. Satish Chandra (1954) & Kharak Singh vs. State of U.P. (1962):</strong> In these early cases, the Supreme Court held that the right to privacy was not a fundamental right explicitly guaranteed by the Constitution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    However, subsequent smaller benches of the SC began to affirm the right to privacy as an aspect of Article 21.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Govind vs. State of M.P. (1975):</strong> The Court recognized the right to privacy as an emanation from Articles 19(1)(d) (right to movement) and 21, but stated it was not absolute and subject to restrictions based on compelling state interest.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>R. Rajagopal vs. State of Tamil Nadu (1994) (Auto Shankar case):</strong> The Court held that the right to privacy includes the "right to be let alone."
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>PUCL vs. Union of India (1997) (Phone Tapping case):</strong> The Court held that telephone tapping by the government violates Article 21 unless it is done in accordance with a procedure established by law which must be just, fair, and reasonable.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) vs. Union of India (2017) (Aadhaar Case / Right to Privacy Case):</h4>
            <p>A nine-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court delivered a landmark unanimous judgment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It overruled the earlier judgments in M.P. Sharma and Kharak Singh that had held privacy was not a fundamental right.</li>
                <li>It declared that the Right to Privacy is a fundamental right, intrinsic to Article 21 (Right to Life and Personal Liberty) and is an integral part of the freedoms guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution.</li>
                <li>The Court clarified that the right to privacy is not absolute and is subject to reasonable restrictions.</li>
                <li>Any State interference with the right to privacy must satisfy a three-fold test:
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>There must be a law in existence.</li>
                        <li>The law must pursue a legitimate state aim.</li>
                        <li>The interference must be proportionate to the object sought to be achieved (proportionality test).</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Implications of Puttaswamy judgment:</h4>
            <p>The judgment has far-reaching implications, impacting areas like data protection (leading to the Personal Data Protection Bill efforts), state surveillance, and individual autonomy. It also played a crucial role in subsequent judgments, such as the decriminalization of homosexuality in the *Navtej Singh Johar vs. Union of India* case, where the right to privacy, dignity, and choice were emphasized.</p>

            <h3>Evolution of Due Process Of Law</h3>
            <p>Article 21 uses the phrase "procedure established by law," which is different from the "due process of law" clause found in the American Constitution. "Due process of law" has two aspects: procedural due process (requiring fair procedure) and substantive due process (allowing courts to question the fairness and reasonableness of the law itself).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Initially, in the <strong>A.K. Gopalan case (1950)</strong>, the Supreme Court rejected the idea of reading "due process" (especially substantive due process) into Article 21. It held that "procedure established by law" meant a procedure laid down by a validly enacted law by the legislature, and courts could not question the wisdom or reasonableness of the law itself, only whether the procedure was followed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <strong>Maneka Gandhi case (1978)</strong> marked a significant shift. The Court held that the "procedure established by law" under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable, and not arbitrary, fanciful, or oppressive. This interpretation brought Article 21 much closer to the American concept of substantive due process, even without explicitly using the term "due process of law."
                </li>
                <li>
                    Though the words "due process of law" are not explicitly adopted in the Indian Constitution in the context of Article 21, the essence of it, particularly the requirement of fairness, reasonableness, and non-arbitrariness in both procedure and the law itself, has been read into "procedure established by law."
                </li>
                <li>Principles of natural justice, such as *audi alteram partem* (hear the other side) and *nemo judex in causa sua* (no one should be a judge in their own cause), are considered essential components of a fair procedure under Article 21.</li>
                <li>Subsequent cases have further strengthened this interpretation, ensuring that any law or executive action depriving a person of life or personal liberty must meet high standards of fairness and reasonableness.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Procedure Established by Law vs. Due Process Of Law</h3>
            <div class="important-box">
                <h4>Comparison:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Parameter: Meaning</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Procedure Established by Law:</em> It means that a law that is duly enacted by the legislature or the concerned body is valid if the correct procedure for its enactment has been followed. It primarily checks if the law has been made correctly.</li>
                            <li><em>Due Process of Law:</em> It means that the law itself must be fair, just, and reasonable, and not arbitrary. It checks not only if the correct procedure was followed in making the law but also examines the substantive fairness of the law.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Parameter: Origin</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Procedure Established by Law:</em> This concept is taken from the Japanese Constitution (though the phrase itself is more general).</li>
                            <li><em>Due Process of Law:</em> This concept has its origin in the United States Constitution (5th and 14th Amendments).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Parameter: Scope</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Procedure Established by Law:</em> Its scope is narrower. If a law is passed by the legislature by following the set procedure, it is considered valid, even if it seems unjust. The court would not go into the reasonableness of the law. (This was the initial interpretation in India).</li>
                            <li><em>Due Process of Law:</em> Its scope is wider. The Supreme Court has a wider range of options for protecting citizens' fundamental rights because this concept allows the judiciary to strike down laws if they are found to be unfair, unreasonable, or arbitrary, even if properly enacted.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Parameter: Purpose</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Procedure Established by Law:</em> Its purpose is to ensure that the process for drafting and passing the law has been correctly followed, and that the law is legally valid.</li>
                            <li><em>Due Process of Law:</em> It checks whether the law in question is not arbitrary and is fair in its application and substance.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Parameter: Constitution (Indian Context)</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Procedure Established by Law:</em> It is explicitly mentioned in Article 21 of the Constitution of India.</li>
                            <li><em>Due Process of Law:</em> It is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of India. However, through judicial interpretation (especially post-Maneka Gandhi), its essence (fairness, justness, reasonableness) has been incorporated into Article 21.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                     <li><strong>Parameter: Judicial Scrutiny</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Procedure Established by Law (Narrow Interpretation):</em> Limits judicial scrutiny to whether the law has been made by following the prescribed procedure.</li>
                            <li><em>Due Process of Law (and current interpretation of Art. 21):</em> Allows for deeper judicial scrutiny into the intrinsic fairness and reasonableness of the law itself.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Parameter: Flaws (as initially understood or if narrowly interpreted)</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Procedure Established by Law:</em> There is a significant flaw in the narrow doctrine. It does not assess the fairness or arbitrariness of parliamentary laws if the procedure was correct. This could potentially lead to unjust laws being upheld.</li>
                            <li><em>Due Process of Law:</em> The doctrine, while ensuring fairness, can sometimes lead to charges of judicial overreach if not applied with restraint, as it involves judges making value judgments on the substantive content of laws. (However, in the context of protecting rights, it's largely seen as a positive development).</li>

            <h1>CRIMINAL JUSTICE (ART 20: PROTECTION IN RESPECT OF CONVICTION FOR OFFENSES)</h1>
            <p>Article 20 of the Constitution grants protection against arbitrary and excessive punishment to an accused person, whether citizen or foreigner or legal person like a company or a corporation. It contains three provisions in that direction:</p>

            <ol type="a">
                <li>
                    <h4>No ex-post-facto law (Article 20(1))</h4>
                    <p>This provision states two things:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>No person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an offence.</li>
                        <li>No person shall be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This limitation is imposed only on criminal laws, and not on civil laws or tax laws. In other words, a civil liability or a tax can be imposed retrospectively. Further, this provision does not prohibit the imposition of civil liability retrospectively.</p>
                    <p>The protection under this provision is available only in respect of conviction or sentence for a criminal offence, and not for preventive detention or demanding security from a person. Moreover, a person can be tried and punished under a law that existed at the time of the commission of the offence, even if such law is later repealed.</p>
                </li>
                <li>

                    <p>This provision states that no person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once.</p>
                    <p>The protection against double jeopardy is available only in proceedings before a court of law or a judicial tribunal. In other words, it is not available in proceedings before departmental or administrative authorities as they are not of judicial nature.</p>

                        <li>Compulsory exhibition of the body.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>RIGHT AGAINST SELF-INCRIMINATION</h2>
            <p>The right against self-incrimination is a fundamental legal principle that ensures individuals are not compelled to testify against themselves in criminal proceedings. It is a safeguard that protects accused persons from coercion or pressure by law enforcement authorities to provide evidence that could incriminate them.</p>

            <h4>Constitutional Basis</h4>
            <p>In India, the right against self-incrimination is enshrined in Article 20(3) of the Constitution, which states, "No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself."</p>

            <h4>Purpose and Significance</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Upholding Human Dignity:</strong> It recognizes the inherent dignity of an individual and prevents the state from using force or deception to extract confessions.</li>
                <li><strong>Ensuring Fair Trial:</strong> It is a cornerstone of a fair trial, ensuring that the burden of proof lies with the prosecution and the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty.</li>
                <li><strong>Preventing Coercion and Torture:</strong> It acts as a crucial check against custodial torture and coercive interrogation tactics by investigative agencies.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintaining Balance of Power:</strong> It helps maintain a balance between the powers of the state and the rights of the individual, preventing an oppressive investigative process.</li>
                <li><strong>Protecting Innocent Individuals:</strong> By preventing forced confessions, it helps protect innocent individuals who might confess under duress to escape harassment or torture.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Scope and Limitations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The protection is available to individuals accused of an offense.</li>
                <li>It is a protection against "testimonial compulsion," meaning being forced to give oral or written statements that are self-incriminatory.</li>
                <li>It does not extend to the compulsory production of material objects or the giving of physical evidence like fingerprints, handwriting samples, or DNA samples, as these are not considered "testimonial" in nature.</li>
                <li>The right does not apply if the statement or confession is made voluntarily, without any compulsion.</li>
                <li>It does not extend to non-criminal proceedings, such as departmental inquiries or civil cases.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="important-box">
                <h4>Implications of Right against self-incrimination:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensures fairness in the criminal justice system by preventing forced confessions.</li>
                    <li>Protects individuals from abusive investigative tactics and custodial violence.</li>
                    <li>Safeguards the presumption of innocence until proven guilty.</li>
                    <li>Reinforces the state's obligation to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt through independent investigation.</li>
                    <li>Upholds the dignity and autonomy of the accused, ensuring they are not treated as mere objects for extracting information.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Important Judicial Pronouncements on Right against self-incrimination</h4>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>M.P. Sharma v. Satish Chandra (1954):</strong>
                The Supreme Court discussed the scope of Article 20(3). It held that "to be a witness" means imparting knowledge in respect of relevant facts by an oral statement or a statement in writing. The person must be "accused of an offence." The protection is against "compulsion" to be a "witness" and compulsion to give evidence "against himself." The court held that the protection did not extend to search and seizure of documents from the accused.
            </div>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>State of Bombay versus Kathi Kalu Oghad (1961) case:</strong>
                The Supreme Court ruled that compelling a person to give specimen handwriting, thumb impressions, fingerprints, or to exhibit parts of the body for identification purposes would not violate the right against self-incrimination under Article 20(3), as this did not amount to being a "witness" in the sense of furnishing evidence based on personal knowledge. It distinguished between testimonial compulsion and identification evidence.
            </div>
            <div class="court-case">
                <strong>Selvi v. State of Karnataka (2010):</strong>
                The Supreme Court held that involuntary administration of narcoanalysis, polygraph tests (lie-detector), and Brain Electrical Activation Profile (BEAP) tests without the consent of the accused would amount to a violation of the right against self-incrimination and also infringes upon the individual's mental privacy. Such tests were deemed testimonial in nature and compelled. However, the Court clarified that if the accused volunteers for these tests, it would be permissible. It also stated that information or material discovered as a result of a voluntary test could be admitted as evidence, subject to Section 27 of the Evidence Act. Obtaining DNA samples was generally considered permissible if crucial for investigation and often falls under the category of physical/material evidence.

    <h2>CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS (ARTICLES 29-30)</h2>

    <h4>Article 29: Protection of Interests of Minorities</h4>
    <p>Article 29 provides the following protections:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Clause (1):</strong> Any section of the citizens residing in the territory of India or any part thereof having a distinct language, script or culture of its own shall have the right to conserve the same.</li>
        <li><strong>Clause (2):</strong> No citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the State or receiving aid out of State funds on grounds only of religion, race, caste, language or any of them.</li>

        <li><strong>Clause (2):</strong> The State shall not, in granting aid to educational institutions, discriminate against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority, whether based on religion or language.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Meaning of "Minority"</h4>

The determination of religious or linguistic minorities is generally done at the state level, but for certain central enactments, it might be considered at the national level. Judicial interpretations have further clarified this aspect over time.</p>

    <h4>Key Supreme Court Judgements on Minority Educational Institutions</h4>

It affirmed that the right to establish and administer is not absolute and can be reasonably regulated for maintaining academic standards and preventing maladministration.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="court-case">
        <strong>Islamic Academy of Education vs. State of Karnataka (2003)</strong>
        <p>This case sought to clarify certain aspects of the T.M.A. Pai judgment, particularly concerning the regulation of admissions and fees in unaided minority educational institutions. It led to the setting up of committees to oversee these aspects, which was later reviewed.</p>

        <strong>P.A. Inamdar & Ors. vs. State of Maharashtra (2005)</strong>

    <h2>ARTICLE 32: RIGHT TO CONSTITUTIONAL REMEDIES AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE</h2>

    <h4>"Heart and Soul of the Constitution"</h4>
    <p>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar described Article 32 as the "very soul of the Constitution and the very heart of it." He emphasized that it is the most important article, without which the Constitution would be a nullity, as it provides an effective remedy for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights.</p>
    <p>Article 32 confers the right to move the Supreme Court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by Part III (Fundamental Rights).</p>

    <h4>Key Features and Significance of Article 32</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Guarantor of Fundamental Rights:</strong> The Supreme Court is constituted as the defender and guarantor of the Fundamental Rights of the citizens.</li>
        <li><strong>Fundamental Right Itself:</strong> The right to move the Supreme Court under Article 32 is itself a Fundamental Right. This ensures that a citizen has a guaranteed right to seek remedy if a Fundamental Right is violated.</li>
        <li><strong>Basic Feature:</strong> The Supreme Court has held that Article 32 is a basic feature of the Constitution. Hence, it cannot be abridged or taken away even by a constitutional amendment.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Suspendable (Generally):</strong> The right to move the Supreme Court under Article 32 cannot be suspended except as otherwise provided by the Constitution, for example, during a National Emergency (Article 359 allows for the suspension of the enforcement of specified Fundamental Rights).</li>
        <li><strong>Scope:</strong> The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 32 is primarily for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights. It is not meant for the enforcement of other legal rights unless a question of Fundamental Rights is involved.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Power of the Supreme Court to Issue Writs</h4>
    <p>For the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights, the Supreme Court has the power to issue directions or orders or writs, including writs in the nature of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Habeas Corpus</li>
        <li>Mandamus</li>
        <li>Prohibition</li>
        <li>Certiorari</li>
        <li>Quo Warranto</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These writs are borrowed from English law where they are known as 'prerogative writs'.</p>

    <h4>Types of Writs and Their Scope</h4>
    <div>
        <h5>Habeas Corpus</h5>
        <p>Literally means "to have the body of." It is an order issued by the court to a person who has detained another to produce the body of the latter before it. The court then examines the cause and legality of the detention. This writ is a powerful safeguard against unlawful or arbitrary detention and can be issued against both public authorities and private individuals.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h5>Mandamus</h5>
        <p>Literally means "we command." It is a judicial command issued by the court to a public official or public body, corporation, inferior court, or tribunal, asking them to perform their official duties which they have failed or refused to perform. It cannot be issued against a private individual or body, or to enforce a discretionary duty or a contractual obligation, nor against the President or State Governors, or against a Chief Justice of a High Court acting in a judicial capacity.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h5>Prohibition</h5>
        <p>Literally means "to forbid." It is a writ issued by a higher court to a lower court or tribunal to prevent the latter from exceeding its jurisdiction or usurping a jurisdiction that it does not possess. Thus, unlike mandamus that directs activity, prohibition directs inactivity. It can be issued only against judicial and quasi-judicial authorities and is not available against administrative authorities, legislative bodies, or private individuals/bodies.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h5>Certiorari</h5>
        <p>Literally means "to be certified" or "to be informed." It is issued by a higher court to a lower court or tribunal either to transfer a case pending with the latter to itself or to quash the order of the latter in a case. It is issued on grounds of excess of jurisdiction, lack of jurisdiction, error of law apparent on the face of the record, or violation of principles of natural justice. While Prohibition is available during the pendency of proceedings, Certiorari is generally available after the order or decision has been announced. The Supreme Court has ruled that Certiorari can also be issued against administrative authorities affecting the rights of individuals.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h5>Quo Warranto</h5>
        <p>Literally means "by what authority or warrant." It is issued by the court to inquire into the legality of a claim of a person to a public office. It prevents the illegal usurpation of a public office by a person. The writ can be issued only if the office in question is a substantive public office of a permanent character created by a statute or by the Constitution, and not a ministerial or private office.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Difference between Supreme Court's (Art 32) and High Court's (Art 226) Writ Jurisdiction</h4>
    <p>While both the Supreme Court and High Courts can issue writs, there are some key differences:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose of Writs:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The Supreme Court can issue writs under Article 32 only for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights, not for any other purpose. Its scope is thus narrower in this respect.</li>
                <li>High Courts can issue writs under Article 226 for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights and also for "any other purpose" (i.e., for the enforcement of an ordinary legal right). The scope of a High Court's writ jurisdiction is wider in this respect.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Territorial Jurisdiction:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The Supreme Court can issue writs against a person or government throughout the territory of India.</li>
                <li>A High Court can issue writs against a person or government only within its own territorial jurisdiction or if the cause of action arises within its territorial jurisdiction, even if the authority is outside.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Nature of Jurisdiction:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The right to move the Supreme Court under Article 32 for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights is itself a Fundamental Right. Therefore, the Supreme Court is bound to entertain such petitions and cannot refuse relief.</li>
                <li>The writ jurisdiction of a High Court under Article 226 is discretionary. A High Court may refuse to exercise its writ powers.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Article 32 does not curtail the power of High Courts under Article 226.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICY (DPSP) - PART IV, ARTICLES 36-51</h2>
    <p>Part IV of the Indian Constitution deals with the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP), covering Articles 36 to 51.</p>

    <h4>Key Features and Significance</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar described these principles as 'novel features' of the Indian Constitution.</li>
        <li>They are akin to an 'Instrument of Instructions' issued to the executive and the legislature.</li>
        <li>DPSPs aim to establish a 'welfare state' by promoting social and economic democracy.</li>
        <li>They are non-justiciable in nature, meaning they are not enforceable by the courts for their violation.</li>
        <li>However, Article 37 declares that these principles are fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the State to apply these principles in making laws.</li>
        <li>They impose a moral obligation on the state authorities for their application.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Classification of Directive Principles</h4>
    <p>Though not formally classified in the Constitution, for better understanding, DPSPs can be broadly categorized into Socialist, Gandhian, and Liberal-Intellectual principles.</p>

    <h5>1. Socialist Principles</h5>
    <p>These principles aim at providing social and economic justice and set the path towards a welfare state. They direct the state to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Article 38:</strong> Promote the welfare of the people by securing a social order permeated by justice—social, economic, and political—and to minimize inequalities in income, status, facilities, and opportunities.</li>
        <li><strong>Article 39:</strong> Secure for all citizens:

    <h2>UNIFORM CIVIL CODE (UCC)</h2>
    <h4>Article 44</h4>
    <p>Article 44 of the Constitution states: "The State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India."</p>

    <h4>Meaning and Context</h4>
    <p>A Uniform Civil Code means one law for the entire country, applicable to all religious communities in their personal matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, adoption, etc. Currently, personal laws of various communities are largely governed by their religious scriptures and customs.</p>
    <p><strong>Current Status of Personal Laws in India:</strong> Most personal laws are separate for different religious communities. For instance, Hindu personal law is codified in acts like the Hindu Marriage Act (1955), Hindu Succession Act (1956), etc. Muslim personal law is largely uncodified and based on Sharia, though some aspects are covered by acts like the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, and Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939. Christians and Parsis also have their own personal laws.</p>

    <h4>Arguments in Favour of UCC</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Promotes national integration and secularism by ensuring that all citizens are governed by the same set of laws in personal matters.</li>
        <li>Ensures gender justice and equality by removing discriminatory practices prevalent in various personal laws, particularly against women.</li>
        <li>Simplifies the legal system by eliminating the complexities arising from different personal laws.</li>
        <li>Reflects the aspirations of a modern, progressive nation that values equality and human rights.</li>
        <li>Fulfills a constitutional directive as envisaged by the framers of the Constitution.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Arguments Against UCC / Challenges in Implementation</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Perceived as an infringement on religious freedom (Article 25) and the right of minorities to conserve their distinct culture (Article 29).</li>
        <li>Practical difficulties in bringing uniformity given India's vast diversity in customs and traditions, even within religious communities.</li>
        <li>Potential for social unrest if implemented without broad consensus and sensitivity.</li>
        <li>Concerns that a UCC might be an imposition of majority views on minority communities.</li>
        <li>Lack of political will and consensus among different stakeholders.</li>
        <li>The complexity of synthesizing various personal laws into a single, comprehensive code acceptable to all.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Supreme Court on UCC</h4>
    <p>The Supreme Court has, in several judgments, highlighted the need for a Uniform Civil Code:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mohammad Ahmed Khan vs. Shah Bano Begum (1985):</strong> The Court observed that Parliament should outline the contours of a common civil code as it is an instrument that binds the country together.</li>
        <li><strong>Sarla Mudgal vs. Union of India (1995):</strong> The Court reiterated the need for a UCC, emphasizing that it would help in national integration by removing contradictions based on ideologies.</li>
        <li><strong>John Vallamattom vs. Union of India (2003):</strong> The Court again expressed regret over the non-enactment of a UCC.</li>
        <li><strong>Shayara Bano vs. Union of India (2017):</strong> While striking down triple talaq, the judgment did not directly enforce UCC but brought personal law practices under judicial scrutiny.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>The Goa Civil Code - A Model?</h4>
    <p>Goa is the only state in India with a form of common civil code, the Portuguese Civil Code of 1867, which continued after its liberation. While often cited as an example, it is not entirely uniform and has specific provisions for different communities, and its direct applicability as a model for the entire country is debated.</p>

    <h4>Way Forward for UCC</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Gradual, step-by-step reforms within personal laws to address discrimination and inequality, rather than a one-time imposition of a UCC.</li>
        <li>Building consensus through dialogue and consultation with all religious communities and stakeholders.</li>
        <li>Codification and reform of existing personal laws to make them gender-just and equitable.</li>
        <li>The Law Commission of India has suggested that a UCC is "neither necessary nor desirable at this stage" and has instead recommended reforms within family laws of each religion.</li>
        <li>Focus on codifying and reforming specific aspects of personal law that are discriminatory, rather than attempting a wholesale UCC immediately.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES (PART IVA - ARTICLE 51A)</h2>

    <h3>Introduction and Background</h3>
    <p>The Fundamental Duties of citizens were added to the Constitution by the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act in 1976.</p>
    <p>Their inclusion was based on the recommendations of the Swaran Singh Committee.</p>
    <p>This concept was inspired by the Constitution of the former USSR, being one of the few democratic constitutions globally to list duties for its citizens.</p>
    <p>Part IVA of the Constitution, which consists of only one Article, 51A, specifies the Fundamental Duties. Initially, there were 10 Fundamental Duties. Later, one more duty was added by the 86th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2002, bringing the total to 11.</p>

    <h3>List of Fundamental Duties (Article 51A)</h3>
    <p>Article 51A states that it shall be the duty of every citizen of India:</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>To abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the National Flag and the National Anthem;</li>
        <li>To cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle for freedom;</li>
        <li>To uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India;</li>
        <li>To defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so;</li>
        <li>To promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities; to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women;</li>
        <li>To value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture;</li>
        <li>To protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wild life, and to have compassion for living creatures;</li>
        <li>To develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform;</li>
        <li>To safeguard public property and to abjure violence;</li>
        <li>To strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement;</li>
        <li>(Added by the 86th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2002) Who is a parent or guardian to provide opportunities for education to his child or, as the case may be, ward between the age of six and fourteen years.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Features of Fundamental Duties</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Some of the duties are moral duties while others are civic duties. For instance, cherishing noble ideals of the freedom struggle is a moral precept, while respecting the Constitution is a civic duty.</li>
        <li>They are confined to citizens only and do not extend to foreigners.</li>
        <li>Similar to the Directive Principles of State Policy, the Fundamental Duties are also non-justiciable. The Constitution does not provide for their direct enforcement by the courts. Hence, there is no legal sanction against their violation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Significance of Fundamental Duties</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>They serve as a reminder to the citizens that while enjoying their rights, they also have certain duties to perform towards their nation, society, and fellow citizens.</li>
        <li>They serve as a warning against anti-national and anti-social activities like burning the national flag or destroying public property.</li>
        <li>They serve as a source of inspiration for the citizens and promote a sense of discipline and commitment among them. They create a feeling that the citizens are not mere spectators but active participants in the realization of national goals.</li>
        <li>They help the courts in examining and determining the constitutional validity of a law. If a court finds that a law in question seeks to give effect to a fundamental duty, it may consider such law to be 'reasonable' in relation to Article 14 (equality before law) or Article 19 (six freedoms), and thus save such law from unconstitutionality.</li>
        <li>They can be made enforceable by law. Parliament is free to enforce them by suitable legislation, providing for penalties or punishments for their violation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Criticism of Fundamental Duties</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The list of duties is not exhaustive as it does not cover other important duties like casting vote, paying taxes, family planning and so on.</li>
        <li>Some of the duties are vague, ambiguous, and difficult to be understood by the common person. For example, terms like ‘noble ideals’, ‘composite culture’, ‘scientific temper’ can be interpreted in different ways.</li>
        <li>Their non-justiciable character has been criticized. Critics argue that making them non-justiciable reduces their importance and utility, rendering them mere moral precepts.</li>
        <li>Their inclusion in the Constitution was described by some critics as superfluous because the duties included are, by and large, such as would be performed by the people even if they were not incorporated into the Constitution.</li>
        <li>The inclusion of fundamental duties as an appendage to Part IV of the Constitution has reduced their value and significance compared to Fundamental Rights in Part III or DPSPs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Verma Committee on Fundamental Duties (1999)</h3>
    <p>The Verma Committee on Fundamental Duties of the Citizens (1999) was appointed to identify the existence of legal provisions for the implementation of some of the Fundamental Duties and to suggest steps for their effective implementation. The committee noted that several legal provisions already exist for enforcing certain duties, for example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act (1971) prevents disrespect to the Constitution of India, the National Flag and the National Anthem (relevant to 51A(a)).</li>
        <li>Various criminal laws aim to punish acts that promote enmity between different groups of people on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc. (relevant to 51A(e)).</li>
        <li>The Protection of Civil Rights Act (1955) provides for punishments for offences related to caste and religious discrimination (relevant to 51A(e)).</li>
        <li>The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act of 1967 provides for the declaration of a communal organisation as an unlawful association (relevant to 51A(c) and (e)).</li>
        <li>The Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972 prohibits trade in rare and endangered species (relevant to 51A(g)).</li>
        <li>The Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980 checks indiscriminate deforestation and diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes (relevant to 51A(g)).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FEDERALISM</h2>

    <h4>Meaning and Essential Features of Federalism</h4>
    <p>Federalism is a system of government in which power is divided between a central national government and various regional governments (like states or provinces). Both levels of government operate directly on the people through their respective officials and laws. Essential features typically include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dual Government:</strong> Existence of two sets of government – one at the national level and the other at the regional level.</li>
        <li><strong>Division of Powers:</strong> A clear distribution of legislative, executive, and financial powers between the national and regional governments, usually outlined in a written constitution.</li>
        <li><strong>Written Constitution:</strong> The existence of a written constitution which is the source of power for both sets of government.</li>
        <li><strong>Supremacy of the Constitution:</strong> The constitution is the supreme law of the land, and laws enacted by either government must conform to it.</li>
        <li><strong>Rigid Constitution:</strong> The procedure for amending the constitution, especially those provisions relating to the federal structure, is typically rigid and requires the consent of both levels of government.</li>
        <li><strong>Independent Judiciary:</strong> An independent judiciary is established to interpret the constitution, decide disputes between the centre and states, or between states, and uphold the sanctity of the constitution.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Federal Government vs. Unitary Government</h4>
    <p>The key differences between federal and unitary systems are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nature of Government:</strong> Federal systems have a dual government structure, while unitary systems have a single government (the central government), from which regional governments, if any, derive their authority.</li>
        <li><strong>Constitution:</strong> Federal systems usually have a written, rigid, and supreme constitution. Unitary systems may have a written (e.g., France) or unwritten (e.g., UK) constitution, which may be flexible and not necessarily supreme (e.g., parliamentary sovereignty in UK).</li>
        <li><strong>Division of Powers:</strong> Powers are constitutionally divided in a federal system. In a unitary system, all powers are vested in the national government, which can delegate powers to regional units.</li>
        <li><strong>Judiciary:</strong> Federal systems typically have an independent judiciary with powers of judicial review. In unitary systems, the judiciary's powers might be more limited in this regard.</li>
        <li><strong>Citizenship:</strong> Federal systems may allow for dual citizenship (national and regional), though India, despite being federal, has single citizenship. Unitary systems typically have single citizenship.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Evolution of Federalism in India</h4>
    <p>Federal ideas in India emerged during the British Raj, with the Government of India Act, 1919, introducing dyarchy and the Government of India Act, 1935, proposing an All-India Federation (though it never fully materialized). The Constituent Assembly, influenced by historical context, the country's diversity, and administrative needs, opted for a federal structure for independent India.</p>

    <h4>Reasons for Adopting a Federal System with a Strong Centre in India</h4>
    <p>India adopted a federal system due to several factors, with a bias towards a strong central government because of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The vast geographical area and immense socio-cultural diversity of the country, making a unitary system impractical.</li>
        <li>The need to accommodate regional aspirations and ensure administrative efficiency.</li>
        <li>Historical lessons, including the experience of partition, which underscored the need for a strong centre to maintain national unity and integrity.</li>
        <li>The imperative for planned economic development and resource mobilization at a national level.</li>
        <li>The need to address common national concerns like defense, foreign policy, and inter-state coordination effectively.</li>
    </ul>

<section id="nature-indian-constitution">
    <h2>NATURE OF THE INDIAN CONSTITUTION</h2>
    <h4>Is the Indian Constitution Truly Federal?</h4>
    <p>The nature of the Indian Constitution has been a subject of debate, with various scholars and judicial pronouncements offering different perspectives. It incorporates features of a federal system as well as significant characteristics of a unitary system, leading to its description as 'quasi-federal' or a 'federation with a strong centralizing tendency'.</p>
    
    <h5>Federal Features of the Indian Constitution:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dual Polity:</strong> The Constitution establishes a dual government system with the Union at the Centre and the States at the periphery, each endowed with sovereign powers to be exercised in the field assigned to them respectively by the Constitution.</li>
        <li><strong>Written Constitution:</strong> India has a comprehensive written constitution that defines the structure, organization, powers, and functions of both the Central and state governments.</li>
        <li><strong>Division of Powers:</strong> The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution clearly demarcates subjects into the Union List, State List, and Concurrent List, assigning legislative powers to the Union and State legislatures.</li>
        <li><strong>Supremacy of the Constitution:</strong> The Constitution is the supreme law of the land. The laws made by the Centre and the states must conform to its provisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Rigid Constitution:</strong> Certain provisions of the Constitution dealing with the federal structure can be amended only by a special majority of Parliament and also with the consent of half of the state legislatures.</li>
        <li><strong>Independent Judiciary:</strong> The Constitution establishes an independent Supreme Court to guard the Constitution and settle disputes between the Centre and the states or amongst states.</li>
        <li><strong>Bicameral Legislature:</strong> The Indian Parliament is bicameral, with the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) representing the states of the Indian Federation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Unitary (or Non-Federal) Features of the Indian Constitution:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Strong Centre:</strong> The division of powers is tilted in favour of the Centre, with more subjects in the Union List, overriding powers on the Concurrent List, and residuary powers vested with the Centre.</li>
        <li><strong>Single Constitution:</strong> Unlike typical federations, the states in India have no right to frame their own constitutions; they follow the single Constitution of India.</li>
        <li><strong>Single Citizenship:</strong> India has a system of single citizenship, meaning all individuals are citizens of India only, not of their respective states.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility of the Constitution:</strong> A significant portion of the Constitution can be amended by the Union Parliament alone, either by a simple majority or a special majority, without the consent of the states.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrated Judiciary:</strong> India has an integrated judicial system with the Supreme Court at the apex, followed by High Courts and subordinate courts, unlike some federations that have separate federal and state court systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Appointment of Governor:</strong> The Governor of a state, who is the constitutional head of the state executive, is appointed by the President and holds office during the President's pleasure, acting as an agent of the Centre.</li>
        <li><strong>All India Services (AIS):</strong> The AIS (IAS, IPS, IFoS) are common to both the Centre and the states, with the Centre having ultimate control over them.</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency Provisions:</strong> During an emergency (National, State, or Financial), the Central government can become all-powerful, and the federal structure can effectively convert into a unitary one.</li>
        <li><strong>Parliament's Authority Over State List:</strong> Parliament can legislate on subjects in the State List under certain circumstances (e.g., if Rajya Sabha passes a resolution, during a National Emergency, for implementation of international agreements).</li>
        <li><strong>No Equality of State Representation:</strong> Representation of states in the Rajya Sabha is not equal but is based on population.</li>
        <li><strong>Parliament's Power to Change Boundaries:</strong> Parliament can alter the boundaries or names of states by a simple majority without their consent (though their views are ascertained).</li>
        <li><strong>Veto Over State Bills:</strong> The Governor can reserve certain types of state bills for the President's consideration, and the President enjoys absolute veto over them.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrated Election Machinery and Audit System:</strong> The Election Commission of India conducts elections for both Central and State legislatures. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) audits the accounts of both the Centre and the States.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Scholarly Views and Judicial Interpretation on Indian Federalism</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>K.C. Wheare:</strong> Famously described the Indian Constitution as "quasi-federal." He stated it is "a unitary state with subsidiary federal features rather than a federal state with subsidiary unitary features."</li>
        <li><strong>Granville Austin:</strong> Characterized Indian federalism as "cooperative federalism," highlighting the need for and existence of cooperation and interdependence between the Union and the States.</li>
        <li><strong>Morris Jones:</strong> Termed it as "bargaining federalism."</li>
        <li><strong>Ivor Jennings:</strong> Called it a "federation with a strong centralizing tendency."</li>
        <li><strong>Paul Appleby:</strong> Described it as "extremely federal."</li>
        <li><strong>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:</strong> Stated in the Constituent Assembly that the Constitution is federal "in as much as it establishes what may be called a Dual Polity" but also has provisions for a strong centre to meet exigencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Supreme Court of India:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In <em>State of West Bengal vs. Union of India (1963)</em>, the SC held that the Indian Constitution is not truly federal.</li>
                <li>However, in <em>S.R. Bommai vs. Union of India (1994)</em>, the Supreme Court held that federalism is a 'basic feature' of the Constitution. It observed that the Indian variant of federalism is tailored to the specific needs of the country.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In essence, the Indian constitutional framework is a unique blend, designed to function as a federal system in normal times but capable of transforming into a more unitary system in specific circumstances, thereby balancing regional autonomy with national unity and strength.</p>

    <h2>CENTRE-STATE RELATIONS</h2>
    <p>The Constitution of India, being federal in structure, divides all powers (legislative, executive, and financial) between the Centre and the States. The relations between the Centre and the States can be studied under the following heads:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Legislative Relations (Articles 245–255, Part XI)</li>
        <li>Administrative Relations (Articles 256–263, Part XI)</li>

    <h3>I. LEGISLATIVE RELATIONS (Articles 245–255)</h3>
    <h4>A. Territorial Extent of Central and State Legislation (Article 245)</h4>
    <p>Article 245 defines the territorial limits of the legislative powers vested in the Centre and the States:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Parliament can make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India. The territory of India includes the states, the union territories, and any other area for the time being included in the territory of India.</li>
        <li>A State Legislature can make laws for the whole or any part of the State. The laws made by a state legislature are not applicable outside the state, except when there is a sufficient nexus between the state and the object.</li>
        <li>Parliament alone can make ‘extra-territorial legislation’ (laws applicable to Indian citizens and their property in any part of the world).</li>
        <li>There are certain restrictions on the plenary territorial jurisdiction of Parliament (e.g., the President can make regulations for the peace, progress, and good government of certain Union Territories; the Governor can direct that an act of Parliament does not apply to a scheduled area in the state or apply with specified modifications).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. Distribution of Legislative Subjects (Article 246 & Seventh Schedule)</h4>
    <p>The Constitution provides for a three-fold distribution of legislative subjects between the Union and the States, as enumerated in the three lists of the Seventh Schedule:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>List I (Union List):</strong> Parliament has exclusive powers to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in this list. It contains subjects of national importance that require uniform legislation throughout the country. Examples include Defence, Banking, Foreign Affairs, Currency, Atomic Energy, Census, Railways, etc. (Originally 97, now 100 subjects).</li>
        <li><strong>List II (State List):</strong> The State Legislature has exclusive powers (under normal circumstances) to make laws with respect to matters enumerated in this list. These are matters of local or regional importance. Examples include Public order, Police, Public health and sanitation, Agriculture, Local Government, Fisheries, etc. (Originally 66, now 61 subjects).</li>
        <li><strong>List III (Concurrent List):</strong> Both Parliament and State Legislatures can make laws on matters enumerated in this list. Examples include Criminal law and procedure, Civil procedure, Marriage and divorce, Education, Forests, Trade unions, Electricity, Economic and social planning, etc. (Originally 47, now 52 subjects).
            <p>In case of a conflict between a Central law and a State law on a subject in the Concurrent List, the Central law prevails over the State law (Article 254). However, if the State law has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent, then the State law prevails in that state. But, Parliament can still override such a law by subsequently making a law on the same matter.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Residuary Powers of Legislation (Article 248):</strong> Parliament has the exclusive power to make any law with respect to any matter not enumerated in the Concurrent List or State List. This includes the power of imposing taxes not mentioned in these lists. This vesting of residuary powers in the Union, contrary to the practice in some other federations (like the USA and Australia where they vest with the states), is another feature reflecting a strong Centre.</p>

    <h4>C. Parliamentary Legislation in the State Field (Supremacy of Parliament)</h4>
    <p>Although the Constitution clearly demarcates subjects, it also empowers Parliament to legislate on subjects in the State List under certain extraordinary circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Article 249 (When Rajya Sabha Passes a Resolution):</strong> If the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) declares by a resolution supported by not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting that it is necessary or expedient in the national interest that Parliament should make laws with respect to a matter in the State List specified in the resolution, Parliament can make laws for the whole or any part of India on that matter. Such a resolution remains in force for one year and can be renewed any number of times but not exceeding one year at a time.</li>
        <li><strong>Article 250 (During a National Emergency):</strong> When a Proclamation of National Emergency (under Article 352) is in operation, Parliament acquires the power to legislate with respect to matters in the State List. The laws so made become inoperative on the expiration of six months after the Emergency has ceased to operate.</li>
        <li><strong>Article 252 (When States Make a Request / By Agreement Between States):</strong> If the Legislatures of two or more States pass resolutions to the effect that it is desirable to have a Parliamentary law on any matter in the State List, Parliament can make laws for regulating that matter. Such a law applies only to those States which have passed the resolutions, though it can be adopted by any other State subsequently by passing a resolution to that effect in its Legislature. Such laws can be amended or repealed only by Parliament.</li>
        <li><strong>Article 253 (To Implement International Agreements):</strong> Parliament can make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India for implementing any treaty, agreement or convention with any foreign country or countries or any decision made at any international conference, association or other body, even if such matters fall within the State List.</li>
        <li><strong>Article 356 (During President's Rule):</strong> When the President’s Rule is imposed in a State, the Parliament becomes empowered to make laws with respect to any matter in the State List in relation to that State. Laws made by Parliament during President's Rule continue to be operative even after the President's Rule, but can be altered or repealed by the State Legislature.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>D. Centre's Control Over State Legislation</h4>
    <p>Besides Parliament's power to legislate directly on state subjects under exceptional situations, the Constitution empowers the Centre to exercise control over the state’s legislative matters in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Governor can reserve certain types of bills passed by the State Legislature for the consideration of the President. The President enjoys absolute veto over such bills (i.e., he can withhold his assent, and the bill does not become an act).</li>
        <li>Bills on certain matters enumerated in the State List can be introduced in the State Legislature only with the previous sanction of the President (e.g., bills imposing restrictions on freedom of trade and commerce).</li>
        <li>The President can direct the States to reserve money bills and other financial bills passed by the State Legislature for his consideration during a Financial Emergency (Article 360).</li>
    </ul>

<section id="administrative-relations-introduction">
    <h3>II. ADMINISTRATIVE RELATIONS (Articles 256–263) - Introduction</h3>
    <p>Articles 256 to 263 in Part XI of the Constitution deal with the administrative relations between the Centre and the States.</p>
    
    <h4>A. Distribution of Executive Powers</h4>
    <p>The executive power has been divided between the Centre and the states on the lines of the distribution of legislative powers, except in a few cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The executive power of the Centre extends primarily to the matters enumerated in the Union List and to the exercise of rights, authority, and jurisdiction conferred on it by any treaty or agreement.</li>
        <li>The executive power of a State extends to its territory in respect of matters enumerated in the State List.</li>
        <li>In respect of matters on the Concurrent List, the executive power ordinarily rests with the States, unless the Constitution or a law of Parliament expressly confers it upon the Centre.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thus, a law on a concurrent subject, though enacted by Parliament, is usually executed by the states unless directed otherwise.</p>

    <h4>B. Obligation of States and the Centre & Centre's Directions to States (Articles 256 & 257)</h4>
    <p>The Constitution has placed two restrictions on the executive power of the states in order to give ample scope to the Centre for exercising its executive power in an unrestricted manner:</p>
    <p><strong>Article 256 (Obligation of states and the Union):</strong> The executive power of every State is to be exercised in such a way as to ensure compliance with the laws made by Parliament and any existing laws which apply in that State. The Union executive is empowered to give such directions to a State as may appear to the Government of India to be necessary for this purpose.</p>
    <p><strong>Article 257 (Control of the Union over States in certain cases):</strong> The executive power of every State shall be so exercised as not to impede or prejudice the exercise of the executive power of the Union. The Union executive can give directions to a State for several purposes, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The construction and maintenance of means of communication declared to be of national or military importance by the Union.</li>
        <li>The measures to be taken for the protection of the railways within the State.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The sanction behind these Central directions is coercive. Article 365 states that where any State has failed to comply with (or to give effect to) any directions given in the exercise of the executive power of the Union under any of the provisions of the Constitution, it shall be lawful for the President to hold that a situation has arisen in which the Government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution (implying invocation of President's Rule under Article 356).</p>

    <h4>C. Mutual Delegation of Functions</h4>
    <p>The division of executive power between the Centre and States can lead to deadlocks. To mitigate this, the Constitution provides for inter-governmental delegation of executive functions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Delegation of Union functions to the States:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Under <strong>Article 258(1)</strong>, the President may, with the consent of the Government of a State, entrust either conditionally or unconditionally to that Government or to its officers functions in relation to any matter to which the executive power of the Union extends.</li>
                <li>Under <strong>Article 258(2)</strong>, Parliament is empowered to make laws conferring powers and imposing duties upon a State or officers and authorities thereof in respect of matters on the Union List. This delegation by Parliament can be made without the consent of the State. When duties are so imposed, the Union is required to pay to the State any extra costs of administration incurred by the State.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Delegation of State functions to the Union:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Under <strong>Article 258A</strong> (added by the 7th Constitutional Amendment, 1956), the Governor of a State may, with the consent of the Government of India, entrust either conditionally or unconditionally to that Government or to its officers functions in relation to any matter to which the executive power of the State extends.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This system of mutual delegation allows for flexibility and cooperation in the administration of subjects.</p>

    <h4>D. Cooperation Between the Centre and States</h4>
    <p>The Constitution contains provisions to secure cooperation and coordination between the Centre and the States and among States themselves:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Article 261 (Public acts, records and judicial proceedings):</strong> Full faith and credit is to be given throughout the territory of India to public acts (legislative and executive), records, and judicial proceedings of the Union and of every State. The manner in which such acts, records and proceedings are to be proved and their effect determined shall be as provided by law made by Parliament. Final judgments or orders of civil courts in any part of India are capable of execution anywhere within India.</li>
        <li><strong>Article 262 (Adjudication of disputes relating to waters of inter-state rivers or river valleys):</strong> Parliament may by law provide for the adjudication of any dispute or complaint with respect to the use, distribution or control of the waters of, or in, any inter-state river or river valley. Parliament may also provide that neither the Supreme Court nor any other court is to exercise jurisdiction in respect of any such dispute or complaint. Accordingly, Parliament has enacted the River Boards Act (1956) and the Inter-State Water Disputes Act (1956).</li>
        <li><strong>Article 263 (Provisions with respect to an Inter-State Council):</strong> If at any time it appears to the President that the public interests would be served by the establishment of a Council, he can establish an Inter-State Council. Its duties can be to (a) inquire into and advise upon disputes which may have arisen between States; (b) investigate and discuss subjects in which some or all of the States, or the Union and one or more of the States, have a common interest; or (c) make recommendations upon any such subject and, in particular, recommendations for the better co-ordination of policy and action with respect to that subject. It was established in 1990 based on the Sarkaria Commission's recommendation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>E. All India Services (Article 312)</h4>
    <p>The Constitution provides for All India Services (AIS) like IAS, IPS, and IFoS, which are common to both the Centre and the States. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>These services are recruited and trained by the Centre.</li>
        <li>Members of these services are appointed to top positions (strategic posts) under both the Centre and the States and serve them by turns.</li>
        <li>Though they are controlled jointly by the Centre and the States, the ultimate control lies with the Central government, while the immediate control vests with the State governments.</li>
        <li>Article 312 of the Constitution authorizes Parliament to create new All India Services on the basis of a resolution passed by the Rajya Sabha to that effect, supported by not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting, declaring that it is necessary or expedient in the national interest to do so.</li>
        <li>All India Services help in maintaining high standards of administration in the Union as well as in the States, ensuring uniformity of the administrative system throughout the country, and facilitating liaison, cooperation, coordination, and joint action on issues of common interest between the Centre and States.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>F. Public Service Commissions</h4>
    <p>The Constitution provides for the following regarding public service commissions to ensure independence and impartiality in recruitment:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Chairman and members of a State Public Service Commission (SPSC), though appointed by the Governor of the State, can be removed only by the President of India.</li>
        <li>Parliament can provide for the establishment of a Joint State Public Service Commission (JSPSC) for two or more States on their request. The chairman and members of the JSPSC are appointed by the President.</li>
        <li>The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) can, with the approval of the President, agree to serve all or any of the needs of a State if requested by the Governor of that State.</li>
        <li>The UPSC assists the States (when requested by two or more States) in framing and operating schemes of joint recruitment for any services for which candidates possessing special qualifications are required.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>G. Integrated Judicial System</h4>
    <p>India has an integrated judicial system, unlike some other federal countries (like the USA) which have separate federal and state court systems. The Supreme Court stands at the apex of this single, unified judicial hierarchy, followed by the High Courts in the states, and then a system of subordinate courts. This single system of courts enforces both Central laws as well as State laws. The appointment, transfer, and removal of High Court judges by the President, and the power of Parliament to establish common High Courts for two or more states, further illustrate the integrated nature and central influence.</p>

    <h4>H. Administrative Relations During Emergencies</h4>
    <p>The Centre-State administrative relations are significantly impacted during the operation of emergencies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>During a National Emergency (Article 352):</strong> The executive power of the Union extends to giving directions to any State as to the manner in which its executive power is to be exercised. The Centre becomes entitled to give executive directions on any matter, effectively bringing state governments under the complete control of the Centre, though they are not suspended.</li>
        <li><strong>During President's Rule (Article 356):</strong> When President's Rule is imposed in a State, the President can assume to himself all or any of the functions of the Government of the State and all or any of the powers vested in or exercisable by the Governor or any body or authority in the State, other than the Legislature of the State. The administration of the state is carried on by or under the authority of the President.</li>
        <li><strong>During a Financial Emergency (Article 360):</strong> The Union can give directions to any State to observe such canons of financial propriety as may be specified in the directions. The President may issue directions for the reduction of salaries and allowances of all or any class of persons serving in connection with the affairs of a State (including High Court judges).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>I. Other Provisions Governing Administrative Relations</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Article 355:</strong> This article imposes two duties on the Centre: (a) to protect every State against external aggression and internal disturbance; and (b) to ensure that the government of every State is carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.</li>
        <li><strong>Article 365:</strong> This article provides a sanction for enforcing Central directions. It states that where any State has failed to comply with, or to give effect to, any directions given in the exercise of the executive power of the Union under any of the provisions of the Constitution, it shall be lawful for the President to hold that a situation has arisen in which the Government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution (and thus invoke Article 356).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>J. Extra-Constitutional Devices for Coordination</h4>
    <p>Besides the constitutional provisions, a number of extra-constitutional advisory bodies and conferences have been established to promote consultation, cooperation, and coordination between the Centre and States. These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India):</strong> Established in 2015, replacing the Planning Commission, to foster cooperative federalism.</li>
        <li><strong>National Development Council (NDC):</strong> (Historically the apex body for decision-making and deliberations on development matters, its role has changed with the abolition of the Planning Commission).</li>
        <li><strong>National Integration Council (NIC).</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Zonal Councils:</strong> These are statutory bodies established by the States Reorganisation Act of 1956 to provide a common meeting ground for states and union territories in each zone to discuss and make recommendations on matters of common interest. There are five Zonal Councils (Northern, Central, Eastern, Western, and Southern).</li>
        <li><strong>North-Eastern Council:</strong> Created by a separate Act of Parliament, the North-Eastern Council Act of 1971, to deal with the special problems of the North-Eastern states.</li>
        <li>Conferences held at regular intervals, such as the Governors' conference (presided over by the President), Chief Ministers' conference (presided over by the Prime Minister), Chief Secretaries' conference, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>III. FINANCIAL RELATIONS (Articles 268–293) - Part 1</h3>
    <p>Part XII of the Constitution, from Articles 268 to 293, deals with Centre-State financial relations. The Constitution makes elaborate provisions relating to the distribution of taxes as well as non-tax revenues and the power of borrowing, supplemented by provisions for grants-in-aid by the Union to the States.</p>

    <h4>A. Allocation of Taxing Powers (Article 265)</h4>
    <p>Article 265 of the Constitution states that "no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law." The Constitution provides for the distribution of taxing powers between the Union and the States through the three lists in the Seventh Schedule:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Union List:</strong> Parliament has exclusive power to levy taxes on subjects enumerated in the Union List (e.g., customs duties, corporation tax, taxes on income other than agricultural income).</li>
        <li><strong>State List:</strong> State Legislatures have exclusive power to levy taxes on subjects enumerated in the State List (e.g., taxes on agricultural income, land revenue, taxes on lands and buildings, excise duties on alcoholic liquors for human consumption, taxes on sale of goods within the state before GST).</li>
        <li><strong>Concurrent List:</strong> There are no tax entries in the Concurrent List. However, the 101st Amendment Act (2016) introduced Article 246A, which gives concurrent power to Parliament and State Legislatures to make laws with respect to Goods and Services Tax (GST).</li>
        <li><strong>Residuary Powers of Taxation:</strong> For matters not enumerated in any list (including taxes), Parliament has the exclusive power to make laws (Article 248).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Constitution also imposes certain restrictions on the taxing powers of the States. For example, a State Legislature is prohibited from imposing a tax on the supply of goods or services or both, where such supply takes place outside the State or in the course of import or export.</p>

    <h4>B. Distribution of Tax Revenues</h4>
    <h5>1. Taxes Levied by the Union but Collected and Appropriated by the States (Article 268)</h5>
    <p>This category includes stamp duties on bills of exchange, cheques, promissory notes, bills of lading, letters of credit, policies of insurance, transfer of shares, debentures, proxies, and receipts. It also included excise duties on medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol or narcotics (before being subsumed by GST for most items). The proceeds of these duties levied within any State, though levied by the Union, are collected and retained by that State and do not form part of the Consolidated Fund of India.</p>

    <h5>2. Taxes Levied and Collected by the Union but Assigned to the States (Article 269)</h5>
    <p>This category includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Taxes on the sale or purchase of goods (other than newspapers) where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce (now largely subsumed under IGST).</li>
        <li>Taxes on the consignment of goods where such consignment takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce (now largely subsumed under IGST).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The net proceeds of these taxes are assigned to the States in accordance with the principles formulated by Parliament.</p>

    <h5>3. Taxes Levied and Collected by the Union and Distributed between the Union and the States (Article 270)</h5>
    <p>This is a significant category covering taxes that are levied and collected by the Union but whose proceeds are then distributed between the Union and the States. This typically includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Taxes on income other than agricultural income.</li>
        <li>Union excise duties (other than those on medicinal and toilet preparations, and now largely subsumed under GST).</li>
        <li>Many other taxes in the Union List not covered under Articles 268, 269, and 271 (surcharge).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The manner of distribution of the net proceeds of these taxes is prescribed by the President on the recommendation of the Finance Commission.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact of Goods and Services Tax (GST):</strong> The 101st Amendment Act of 2016 has fundamentally altered the landscape of indirect taxation and Centre-State financial relations.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Article 246A:</strong> Confers concurrent taxing powers on the Union and State legislatures with respect to GST. Parliament has exclusive power over inter-State trade or commerce (IGST).</li>
            <li><strong>Article 269A:</strong> Deals with the levy and collection of GST in the course of inter-State trade or commerce (IGST). Such tax is levied and collected by the Government of India and apportioned between the Union and States on the recommendations of the GST Council.</li>
            <li><strong>Article 270:</strong> Has been amended to reflect that taxes levied and collected by the Union and distributed now include IGST (after deducting the portion apportioned to states under Article 269A) and specific cesses and surcharges are excluded from the divisible pool unless Parliament provides for their sharing.</li>
            <li><strong>Article 271 (Surcharge on certain duties and taxes for purposes of the Union):</strong> Parliament may at any time increase any of the duties or taxes referred to in Articles 269 and 270 by a surcharge for purposes of the Union and the whole proceeds of any such surcharge shall form part of the Consolidated Fund of India (i.e., not shareable with states unless Parliament decides).</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><em>(Note: Other aspects of financial relations such as Grants-in-Aid (Articles 275 and 282), the role of the Finance Commission (Article 280), borrowing powers, and inter-governmental tax immunities would typically follow in a comprehensive discussion of financial relations.)</em></p>
